36929451,Integration of clinical and spatial data to explore lipid metabolism-related genes for predicting prognosis and immune microenvironment in gliomas.,"Lipid metabolism is crucial to tumor growth and immune microenvironment as well as drug sensitivity in glioma. Identifying prognostic indicators of glioma and elucidating the mechanisms of glioma progression are critical for improving the prognosis of glioma patients. In this study, we investigated the role and prognostic value of metabolism-related genes in glioma by integrative analysis of datasets from GEO, CGGA, and TCGA. Based on clinical data and transcriptome data, we found that the expression pattern of three major pathways related to lipid metabolism is fatty acid<sup>high</sup>-phospholipid<sup>high</sup>-triglyceride<sup>low</sup>, which is associated with better prognosis and immune infiltration. The genes involved in these three pathways were used to generate a prognostic model, which showed high stability and efficiency in the test set and validation set. The spatial transcriptome of glioma patients revealed that the microenvironment of the regions with high expression of risk genes CAV1 and SCD is in a state of hypoxia, EMT, and cell cycle arrest, and thus can be used as markers of metabolic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment. In the high-risk group, M0 macrophages and M1 macrophages were significantly enriched, and the risk score was significantly correlated with gene mutation and methylation of risk genes. We further performed drug sensitivity screening corresponding to different risk genes. This study provided novel insights into the differential immune microenvironment with different expression patterns of metablism-related genes and highlighted the spatial and temporal synergy of tumor progression and metabolic reprogramming.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\36929451.txt,1,"Lipid metabolism is crucial to tumor growth and immune microenvironment as well as drug sensitivity in glioma.

30513309,Circular RNA involvement in aging: An emerging player with great potential.,"Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of newly discovered noncoding RNA (ncRNA), presenting as a special covalent loop without a 5' cap or 3' tail. Multiple biological properties of circRNA have been revealed during the past decades, such as widespread expression, high conservation, cell-specificity, tissue-specificity and developmental stage-specific expression patterns, as well as resistance to RNase R digestion. CircRNA also exhibits diverse biological functions, including regulation of host genes, alternative splicing, miRNA sponges, protein traps and even protein synthesis. Recently, a global accumulation of circRNAs during aging has been identified across different species, indicating a potential role as a causal factor in aging and age-related disease. The high stability could be one of the mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon. CircRNA could play a role in aging, such as neural aging, muscle aging, reproductive aging, skin aging, immunosenescence, visual aging and age-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease, via interaction with miRNAs, RNA binding proteins, modulation of parental gene transcription, mainly at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The present study will focus on the advancement of circRNA regarding aging and age-related diseases.

31177124,Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Q192R and L55M Polymorphisms as Potential Predisposition Factors for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: PON1 gene has an executive role in antioxidant defense, protecting cells from genotoxic factors. Q192R and L55M PON1 polymorphisms reduce catalytic activity of the encoded protein. These polymorphisms were studied in 300 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and 106 healthy donors. They were also associated with patients' cytogenetic findings, to investigate their possible implication in CLL pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SNP genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Karyotypic analysis was also performed by chromosome G-banding analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Genotypic and allelic distribution of Q192R polymorphism showed a statistically significant higher frequency of mutant genotypes and mutant alleles in patients compared to controls. The same observation was noted in patients with abnormal karyotypes and those carrying abn14q32 and del(6q). A statistically increased frequency for the mutant allele was also revealed in patients with del(11q). On the contrary, L55M polymorphism showed a similar distribution between patients and controls.

31217437,Adenoviral vaccine targeting multiple neoantigens as strategy to eradicate large tumors combined with checkpoint blockade.,"Neoantigens (nAgs) are promising tumor antigens for cancer vaccination with the potential of inducing robust and selective T cell responses. Genetic vaccines based on Adenoviruses derived from non-human Great Apes (GAd) elicit strong and effective T cell-mediated immunity in humans. Here, we investigate for the first time the potency and efficacy of a novel GAd encoding multiple neoantigens. Prophylactic or early therapeutic vaccination with GAd efficiently control tumor growth in mice. In contrast, combination of the vaccine with checkpoint inhibitors is required to eradicate large tumors. Gene expression profile of tumors in regression shows abundance of activated tumor infiltrating T cells with a more diversified TCR repertoire in animals treated with GAd and anti-PD1 compared to anti-PD1. Data suggest that effectiveness of vaccination in the presence of high tumor burden correlates with the breadth of nAgs-specific T cells and requires concomitant reversal of tumor suppression by checkpoint blockade.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31217437.txt,1,"Neoantigens (nAgs) are promising tumor antigens for cancer vaccination with the potential of inducing robust and selective T cell responses.

31492174,The first report of molecular characterized BRD4-NUT carcinoma in Brazil: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: NUT midline carcinoma is a rare and aggressive subset of squamous cell carcinoma, which is characterized by the translocation of nuclear protein in testis gene that is mostly fused with bromodomain and extraterminal family proteins. We describe here the first Brazilian case of NUT midline carcinoma with BRD4-NUT fusion detected in a next-generation sequencing panel and we present the clinical evolution of this patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left maxillary sinus, with negative in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr encoding region and human papillomavirus genotyping. He received induction therapy, chemoradiotherapy with weekly systemic chemotherapy, and, concurrently, weekly intra-arterial chemotherapy. New imaging evaluation, 1 month after the end of the last treatment, revealed a good partial response in the primary lesion. However, positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed multiple suspicious lesions in his bones and lungs, which were histologically confirmed. He died exactly 2 months after metastatic disease was diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: NUT midline carcinoma is usually very aggressive. Currently, there is no standard of care for treatment of NUT midline carcinoma. The definitive diagnosis must be by demonstration of NUTM1 rearrangement. Immunohistochemical staining of greater than 50% of tumor nuclei on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using the monoclonal rabbit antibody to NUT (clone C52B1), has a specificity of 100%, and sensitivity of 87% for the diagnosis of NUT midline carcinoma.

30955263,[Dedifferentiated liposarcoma with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor-like features: a clinicopathological analysis of five cases].,"Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT)-like features. Methods: Five cases of DDLPS with IMT-like features were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the First People's Hospital of Qinzhou between 2013 and 2018. EnVision method and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect the immunophenotype of the tumor cells and the profile of MDM2 gene amplification respectively. Results: All five cases were male and the median age was 61 (range 53 to 65) years. The clinical symptoms were mainly related to the space-occupying lesions. The tumors were located in duodenal mesentery (two cases), intestinal wall (one case), retroperitoneum (one case), and spermatic cord (one case). Grossly, the tumors were not well encapsulated, ranging from 3 to 13 cm (median 6.7 cm) in diameter, with tan to gray and firm cut surface. Histologically, the dedifferentiated component closely resembled inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), with spindle/polygonal/stellate-shaped cells arranged in storiform, sheet-like, or random pattern, with varying degrees of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. All three major patterns seen in IMT (myxoid, cellular and hypocellular fibrous) were observed, the hypocellular fibrous pattern was the most common. Well-differentiated liposarcomatous component was found in the peripheral areas of all the tumors. One case had high grade dedifferentiated component. Four cases were strongly positive for MDM2 and p16. Two cases were positive for SMA, and one case was focally positive for desmin and one for CD34. None of the cases stained for ALK-1. FISH demonstrated MDM2 gene amplification in all five cases. Clinical follow-ups were available in all five cases and the interval ranged from 3 to 66 months (median 23 months). Two patients developed recurrences and one patient had metastasis. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of tumor recurrence at 3 and 14 months after surgery respectively. Conclusions: DDLPS with IMT-like features is a more aggressive neoplasm than its histological mimic (IMT), and should not be misdiagnosed as other intermediate or low-grade malignant tumors, such as IMT, sclerosing liposarcoma, inflammatory liposarcoma, aggressive fibromatosis, solitary fibrous tumors, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, and low-grade fibrosarcoma.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\30955263.txt,1,"Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT)-like features.

31330366,Molecular pathogenesis of gallbladder cancer: An update.,"Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is the most aggressive gastrointestinal malignancy throughout the world, with wide geographical variance. It is the subtype of biliary tract malignancy that has the poorest prognosis and lower survival among all biliary tract malignancies. Various factors are associated with GBC pathogenesis such as environmental, microbial, metabolic and molecular. Chronic inflammation of gallbladder due to presence of gallstone or microbial infection (eg. Salmonella or H. pylori) results in sustained production of inflammatory mediators in the tissue microenvironment, which can cause genomic changes linked to carcinogenesis. Genetic alterations are one of the major factors, associated with aggressiveness and prognosis. Researches have been done to explore suitable biomarker for early diagnosis and identify altered molecular pathways to develop appropriate biomarkers for early diagnosis, therapy and predicting prognosis. Different agents for targeted therapy against actionable mutations of molecules like EGFR, VEGF, mTOR, HER2, PDL-1, PD-1, MET, PI3K, N-cadherin, VEGFR, MEK1 and MEK2 are being tried. Despite these advancements, there is dismal improvement in the survival of GBC patients.

Due to the increased risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis when left in place, IVCF removal is indicated once anticoagulant treatment can be reintroduced. However, many temporary IVCF are not removed. We aimed to analyze the removal rate and predictors of filter non-removal in a university hospital setting.
We collected all the data of consecutive patients who had a retrievable IVCF inserted at the Saint-Etienne University Hospital (France) between April 2012 and November 2019. Rates of filter removal were calculated. We analyzed patient characteristics to assess factors associated with filter non-removal, particularly in patients without a definitive filter indication. The exclusion of this last category of patients allowed us to calculate an adjusted removal rate.
The overall removal rate of IVCF was 40.5% (IC 95% 35.6-45.6), and the adjusted removal rate was 62.9 % (IC 95% 56.6-69.2%). No major complications were noted. Advanced age (p < 0.0001) and cancer presence (p < 0.003) were statistically significant predictors of patients not being requested to make a removal attempt.

However, the relationship between HGPs of liver metastasis and clinicopathological and genomic characteristics of primary cancer has not been well established. AIM: To assess whether certain clinicopathological and genomic features of primary CRC could predict the HGPs of liver metastasis. METHODS: A total of 29 patients with paired resections of both primary CRC and liver metastasis were divided into two groups: A (15 cases with desmoplastic liver metastasis) and B (14 cases with replacement liver metastasis). Clinical information was obtained from patients' charts. Mismatch repair proteins, BRAFV600E, and PD-L1 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Five cases were selected randomly from each group for whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis. RESULTS: In the primary tumor, expanding growth pattern, low tumor budding score (TBS), and Crohn's disease-like response (CDR) were associated with desmoplastic liver metastasis and better overall survival, whereas infiltrating growth pattern alone of primary carcinoma could predict the replacement liver metastasis and worse overall survival (P < 0.05).

CONCLUSION: The HGPs, TBS, and CDR of primary CRC as well as the presence of specific genetic mutations such as those in PIK3CA could be used to predict the HGPs of liver metastasis, response to therapy, and patients prognosis.","['tumor', 'cancer', 'carcinoma']",1
36607719,Application of Intraoperative Rapid Molecular Diagnosis in Precision Surgery for Glioma: Mimic the World Health Organization CNS5 Integrated Diagnosis.,"With the advent of the molecular era, the diagnosis and treatment systems of glioma have also changed. A single histological type cannot be used for prognosis grade. Only by combining molecular diagnosis can precision medicine be realized.
To develop an automatic integrated gene detection system (AIGS) for intraoperative detection in glioma and to explore its positive role in intraoperative diagnosis and treatment.
We analyzed the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation status of 105 glioma samples and evaluated the product's potential value for diagnosis; 37 glioma samples were detected intraoperatively to evaluate the feasibility of using the product in an actual situation. A blinding method was used to evaluate the effect of the detection technology on the accuracy of intraoperative histopathological diagnosis by pathologists. We also reviewed the current research status in the field of intraoperative molecular diagnosis.
Compared with next-generation sequencing, the accuracy of AIGS in detecting IDH1 was 100% for 105 samples and 37 intraoperative samples. The blind diagnostic results were compared between the 2 groups, and the molecular information provided by AIGS increased the intraoperative diagnostic accuracy of glioma by 16.2%. Using the technical advantages of multipoint synchronous detection, we determined the tumor molecular margins for 5 IDH-positive patients and achieved accurate resection at the molecular level.
AIGS can quickly and accurately provide molecular information during surgery. This methodology not only improves the accuracy of intraoperative pathological diagnosis but also provides an important molecular basis for determining tumor margins to facilitate precision surgery.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\36607719.txt,1,"With the advent of the molecular era, the diagnosis and treatment systems of glioma have also changed.

36586323,Is there a role for tumor volume in prediction of prognosis for oral cancer?,"New prognostic factors in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (tumor-, host-, and environment-related) have been introduced recently to complete those traditionally considered. Among them, tumor volume (TV) could be the most interesting and applicable in clinical practice, considering the routine use of computed tomography in tumor staging. In this retrospective study we aimed to investigate whether a correlation exists among these new prognostic factors and survival outcomes.
We collected data about 140 patients affected by OSCC who underwent primary surgery. Prognostic factors were collected and Overall Survival (OS), Disease Specific Survival (DSS) and Disease Free Survival (DFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method; the Log-Rank test (Mantel-Cox) and Cox regression models were applied to investigate predictors of survival.
The 5-year OS, DSS and DFS were 73.6 %, 89.2 % and 75.2 % respectively. Nodal metastasis (pN+), relapse and American Society of Anesthesiologists ASA-II were found independent prognostic factors for OS, and significantly associated to worst DSS (p < 0.001). TV significantly correlated with higher relapse occurrence (p = 0.03).
In our experience, lymph-node status, ASA classification and relapse significantly influenced DSS on univariate analysis.

Conventional genetic analyses are underpowered to address these questions. Through careful selection of patients based on protein aggregation phenotype (rather than clinical diagnosis) we can increase statistical power to detect associated variants in a targeted set of genes that modify proteotoxicities. Genetic modifiers of alpha-synuclein (ɑS) and beta-amyloid (Aβ) cytotoxicity in yeast are enriched in risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively.

31009132,Frequency of isolated cutaneous involvement in adult mastocytosis: a cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is characterized by the accumulation/proliferation of abnormal mast cells. The frequency of isolated cutaneous involvement in adults with mastocytosis has not been fully determined. The main objective of our study was to assess the frequency of isolated cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) in adults with mastocytosis skin lesions. The second objective was to compare the clinical, histological, biological and imaging features in patients with isolated CM and patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM). METHODS: We included all patients with histology-proven mastocytosis skin lesions between January 2009 and December 2017. The mastocytosis diagnosis was made according to the international diagnostic criteria. All data were collected from a dedicated specific case report. RESULTS: Among 160 patients with mastocytosis skin lesions, 25 patients had isolated CM (15.6%), 105 had SM and 30 (18.7%) patients had undetermined mastocytosis. Skin KIT mutation (OR: 51.9, 95% CI: 3.9-678, P = 0.001) and high bone marrow tryptase (OR: 97.4, 95% CI: 10.3-915, P = 0.001) were strong predictors of SM. The prevalence of osteoporosis was higher in the SM population than in the isolated CM population. Moreover, a decrease in bone mineral density over a short period of follow-up (1-2 years) was associated with SM. There were no differences between the two groups regarding the frequency of mast cell activation symptoms, the presentation of skin lesions, the number of mast cells in the dermis and the level of serum tryptase.

25367873,Early-onset Crohn's disease and autoimmunity associated with a variant in CTLA-4.,"OBJECTIVE: IBD is a group of complex, systemic disorders associated with intestinal inflammation and extraintestinal manifestations. Recent studies revealed Mendelian forms of IBD, which contributed significantly to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and the heritability of IBD. DESIGN: We performed exome sequencing in a family with Crohn's disease (CD) and severe autoimmunity, analysed immune cell phenotype and function in affected and non-affected individuals, and performed in silico and in vitro analyses of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) structure and function. RESULTS: A novel missense variant was identified in CTLA4 encoding CTLA-4, a coinhibitory protein expressed by T cells and required for regulation of T cell activation. The residue affected by the mutation, CTLA-4 Tyr60, is evolutionarily highly conserved, and the identified Y60C variant is predicted to affect protein folding and structural stability and demonstrated to cause impaired CTLA-4 dimerisation and CD80 binding. Intestinal inflammation and autoimmunity in carriers of CTLA-4 Y60C exhibit incomplete penetrance with a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic carrier status to fatal autoimmunity and intestinal inflammation. In a clinically affected CTLA-4 Y60C carrier, T cell proliferation was increased in vitro and associated with an increased ratio of memory to naive T cells in vivo, consistent with impaired regulation of T cell activation.

Objectives: We aimed to elucidate the clinical usefulness of measuring PGE-MUM as an indicator of tumor burden in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: PGE-MUM was measured by a radioimmunoassay in control healthy volunteers (n = 124) and patients with lung adenocarcinoma (n = 54). Associations between PGE-MUM levels and clinical characteristics of the patients (including lung cancer stage and TNM factors (T: Tumor, N: Node, M: Metastasis) were examined.

38438086,MicroRNA-7 Attenuates Secondary Brain Injury Following Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage via Inhibition of NLRP3.,"The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying brain injury resulting from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remain incompletely elucidated, and efficacious therapeutic interventions to enhance the prognosis of ICH patients are currently lacking. Previous research indicates that MicroRNA-7 (miR-7) can suppress the expression of Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), thereby modulating neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. However, the potential regulatory effects miR-7 on NLRP3 inflammasome after ICH are yet to be established. This study aims to ascertain whether miR-7 mitigates secondary brain injury following experimental ICH by inhibiting NLRP3 and to investigate the underlying mechanisms.
An ICH model was established by stereotaxically injecting 100 μL of autologous blood into the right basal ganglia of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Subsequently, these rats were allocated into three groups: sham, ICH + Vehicle, and ICH + miR-7, each comprising 18 animals. Twelve hours post-modeling, rats received intraventricular injections of 10 μL physiological saline, 10 μL phosphate, and 10 μL phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.5 nmol of miR-7 mimics, respectively. Neurological function was assessed on day three post-modeling, followed by euthanasia for brain tissue collection. Brain water content was determined using the dry-wet weight method. The expression of inflammatory cytokines in cerebral tissues surrounding the hematoma was analyzed through immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays. These cytokines were re-evaluated using Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Moreover, bioinformatics tools were employed to predict miR-7's binding to NLRP3. A wild-type luciferase reporter gene vector and a corresponding mutant vector were constructed, followed by transfection of miR-7 mimics into HEK293T cells to assess luciferase activity.
Our study demonstrates that the administration of miR-7 mimics markedly reduced neurological function scores and attenuated brain edema in rats following ICH. A significant upregulation of NLRP3 expression in microglia/macrophage adjacent to the hematoma was observed, substantially reduced after the treatment with miR-7 mimics. Furthermore, this intervention ameliorated neurodegenerative changes and effectively decreased the protein and mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and Caspase1, in the cerebral tissues proximate to the hematomas. In addition, miR-7 mimics distinctly inhibited the luciferase activity associated with the wild-type reporter gene, an effect not mirrored in its mutant variant.

31443309,Malignant Pleural Effusion and Its Current Management: A Review.,"Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is an exudative effusion with malignant cells. MPE is a common symptom and accompanying manifestation of metastatic disease. It affects up to 15% of all patients with cancer and is the most common in lung, breast cancer, lymphoma, gynecological malignancies and malignant mesothelioma. In the last year, many studies were performed focusing on the pathophysiological mechanisms of MPE. With the advancement in molecular techniques, the importance of tumor-host cell interactions is becoming more apparent. Additionally, the process of pathogenesis is greatly affected by activating mutations of EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, MET, EML4/ALK and RET, which correlate with an increased incidence of MPE. Considering all these changes, the authors aim to present a literature review of the newest findings, review of the guidelines and pathophysiological novelties in this field. Review of the just recently, after seven years published, practice guidelines, as well as analysis of more than 70 articles from the Pubmed, Medline databases that were almost exclusively published in indexed journals in the last few years, have relevance and contribute to the better understanding of the presented topic.

28295149,"Enlarged posterior fossa on prenatal imaging: differential diagnosis, associated anomalies and postnatal outcome.","INTRODUCTION: The primary aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of the individual conditions and of associated anomalies in fetuses with the prenatal diagnosis of enlarged posterior fossa (PF) and to explore the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in these anomalies. The secondary aim was to evaluate the postnatal outcome of children affected by PF anomalies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All fetuses with enlarged PF detected by prenatal sonography at a referral center from 2001 to 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Some were also studied by fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or volume ultrasound examinations. Fetal sonographic and MRI were compared using following classification: Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM); megacisterna magna (MCM); Blake's pouch cyst; isolated vermian hypoplasia; vermian agenesis; PF arachnoid cyst (AC); and cerebellar hypoplasia (CH). RESULTS: The ultrasound diagnoses of the 69 fetuses were as follows: MCM (n = 29; of these isolated n = 15), DWM (n = 28, isolated n = 4), vermian hypoplasia (n = 5, isolated n = 4), Blake's pouch cyst (n = 4, isolated n = 1), CH (n = 2; none isolated) and AC in the PF (n = 1, isolated). Thirteen of the 41 karyotyped fetuses were aneuploid, including seven with DWM. Associated malformations were found in 37/69 cases. There were 39 live births, including 11 with confirmed DWM, six of whom show a normal development. Twelve infants with isolated MCM show normal development. There were eight false-positive prenatal diagnoses (or resolution until birth) of ""enlarged PF"": three with Blake's pouch cyst, two with MCM and one with vermian hypoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: An enlarged PF requires specific diagnoses for the best possible counseling. The term ""Dandy-Walker variant"" should not be used anymore.

30878469,AGA Clinical Practice Update on Interaction Between Oral Direct-Acting Antivirals for Chronic Hepatitis C Infection and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Expert Review.,"DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this clinical practice update is to evaluate the evidence describing the interaction between direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with regard to HCC incidence, HCC recurrence, and DAA efficacy, and to summarize best practice advice regarding HCC surveillance and timing of DAA therapy. METHODS: The recommendations outlined in this expert review are based on available published evidence, including observational studies and systematic reviews, and incorporates expert opinion where applicable. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: DAA treatment is associated with a reduction in the risk of incident HCC. The relative risk reduction is similar in patients with and without cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with advanced liver fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis should receive surveillance imaging before initiating DAA treatment. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with advanced liver fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis at the time of DAA treatment represent the highest-risk group for HCC after DAA-induced sustained virologic response. These patients should stay in HCC surveillance. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: HCC surveillance should be performed using ultrasound with or without alpha-fetoprotein every 6 months. Current data do not support shorter surveillance intervals or the use of alternative surveillance modalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Future studies may show a reduction in HCC risk over time after DAA-induced sustained virologic response. However, in the interim, HCC surveillance should continue indefinitely if patients are otherwise eligible for potentially curative therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: The presence of active HCC is associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in sustained virologic response with DAA therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Patients with HCC who are eligible for potentially curative therapy with liver resection or ablation should defer DAA therapy until after HCC treatment is completed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Timing of DAA therapy for patients with HCC who are listed for liver transplantation should be determined with consideration of median wait times, availability of hepatitis C virus-positive organs, and degree of liver dysfunction. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: There are insufficient data evaluating benefits and cost-effectiveness of DAA therapy in patients with active intermediate or advanced HCC. Decisions regarding DAA treatment in these patients should be considered in light of HCC tumor burden, degree of liver dysfunction, life expectancy, and patient preferences. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: There are no conclusive data that DAA therapy is associated with increased or decreased risk, differential time to recurrence, or aggressiveness of recurrent HCC in patients with complete response to HCC therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: DAA therapy should not be withheld from patients with complete response to HCC therapy; however, DAA therapy can be deferred 4-6 months to confirm response to HCC therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Patients with complete response to HCC therapy who are treated with DAAs have a continued risk of HCC recurrence and require HCC surveillance, which should be conducted indefinitely with dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging every 3-6 months.

Whether HFCS contributes directly to tumorigenesis is unclear. We investigated the effects of daily oral administration of HFCS in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutant mice, which are predisposed to develop intestinal tumors. The HFCS-treated mice showed a substantial increase in tumor size and tumor grade in the absence of obesity and metabolic syndrome. HFCS increased the concentrations of fructose and glucose in the intestinal lumen and serum, respectively, and the tumors transported both sugars. Within the tumors, fructose was converted to fructose-1-phosphate, leading to activation of glycolysis and increased synthesis of fatty acids that support tumor growth. These mouse studies support the hypothesis that the combination of dietary glucose and fructose, even at a moderate dose, can enhance tumorigenesis.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\30898933.txt,1,"Excessive consumption of beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is associated with obesity and with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

37404298,Dynamic Rod Constructs as the Preventive Strategy against Adjacent Segment Disease in Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Disorders: A Retrospective Comparative Cohort Study.,"Adjacent segment degeneration (ASDe) and adjacent segment disease (ASDi) are potential long-term complications after lumbar fusion with rigid instrumentation. Dynamic fixation techniques (Topping-off) adjacent to the fused segments have been developed to curtail the risk of ASDe and ASDi. The current study sought to investigate whether the addition of dynamic rod constructs (DRC) in patients with preoperative degeneration in the adjacent disc was effective in reducing the risk of ASDi.
A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data of 207 patients with degenerative lumbar disorders (DLD) from January 2012 to January 2019, who underwent posterior transpedicular lumbar fusion (without Topping-off, NoT/O), and posterior dynamic instrumentation with DRC. Clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and lumbar radiographs one, three, and 12 months postoperatively and annually. ASDe was defined as disc height collapse > 20% and disc wedging > 5. Patients with confirmed ASDe and aggravation of ODI > 20 or VAS score > 5 at final follow-up were diagnosed as ASDi. The Kaplan-Meier hazard method was used to estimate the cumulative probability of ASDi within 63 months of surgery.
Over three years of follow-up, 65 patients in the NoT/O (59.6%) and 52 cases (53.1%) in the DRC groups met the diagnostic criteria for ASDe. Furthermore, 27 (24.8%) patients in the NoT/O group showed ASDi during the follow-up, compared to 14 (14.3%) cases in the DRC group (<i>P</i>=0.059). Revision surgery was performed on 19 individuals in the NoT/O and 8 cases in the DRC groups (<i>P</i>=0.048). The Cox regression model identified a significantly decreased risk of ASDi if DRC was used (Hazard ratio: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.13-0.6).

31602373,Detection of Novel Fusion Transcript VTI1A-CFAP46 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is now the second-highest cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent studies have discovered a wide range of somatic mutations in HCC. These mutations involve various vital signaling pathways such as: Wnt/beta-Catenin, p53, telome-rase reverse transcriptase (TERT), chromatin remodeling, RAS/MAPK signaling, and oxidative stress. However, fusion transcripts have not been broadly explored in HCC. METHODS: To identify novel fusion transcripts in HCC, in the first phase of our study, we performed targeted RNA sequencing (in HCC and paired non-HCC tissues) on 6 patients with a diagnosis of HCC undergoing liver transplantation. RESULTS: As a result of these studies, we discovered the novel fusion transcript, VTI1A-CFAP46. In the second phase of our study, we measured the expression of wild-type VTI1A in 21 HCC specimens, which showed that 10 of 21 exhibited upregulation of wild-type VTI1A in their tumors. VTI1A (Vesicle Transport via Interaction with t-SNARE homolog 1A) is a member of the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) gene family, which is essential for membrane trafficking and function in endocytosis, autophagy, and Golgi transport. Notably, it is known that autophagy is involved in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: The link between novel fusion transcript VTI1A-CFAP46 and autophagy as a potential therapeutic target in HCC patients deserves further investigation.

36930129,Rectum adenocarcinoma metabolic subtypes analysis and a risk prognostic model construction based on fatty acid metabolism genes.,"Fatty acid metabolism is an essential part of cancer research due to its role in cancer initiation and progression. However, its characteristics and prognostic value in rectum adenocarcinoma have not been systematically evaluated. We collected fatty acid metabolism gene expression profiles and clinical information from the cancer genome atlas and gene expression omnibus databases. After excluding individuals lacking clinical information and the presence of genetic mutations, we performed consistent clustering of the remaining patients and selected stable clustering results to group patients. Differentially expressed genes and gene set enrichment analysis were compared between subgroups, while metabolic signature identification and decoding the tumor microenvironment were performed. In addition, we explored the survival status of patients among different subgroups and identified signature genes affecting survival by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Finally, we selected signature genes to construct a risk prognostic model by multivariate Cox regression and evaluated model efficacy by univariate Cox regression and the receiver operating characteristic curve. By consensus clustering, patients were distinguished into 2 stable subpopulations, gene set enrichment analysis and metabolic signature identification effectively defined 2 completely different subtypes of fatty acid metabolism: fatty acid catabolic subtype and fatty acid anabolic subtype. Among them, patients with the fatty acid catabolic subtype had a poorer prognosis, with a significantly lower proportion of myeloid dendritic cells infiltration within the tumor microenvironment.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the osteoclastogenesis phenotype by histologic examination of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) localization and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and to correlate the results to disease aggressiveness to define prognostic indicators. Based on cherubism evolution 1 year after surgery, 3 classes of cherubism aggressiveness were identified: mild (group A), moderate (group B), and severe (group C). Histologically, in grade A and B cherubism lesions, GMCs were negative for both TRAP activity and NFATc1 nuclear localization. In contrast, in grade C cherubism lesions, GMCs were all positive for TRAP activity and NFATc1 nuclear localization and displayed osteoclast-like features. Other histopathologic findings were not different among the 3 groups. Our results establish that TRAP activity and NFTAc1 nuclear localization are associated with aggressive cherubism and therefore could be added to routine pathologic examination to aid in prognosis and management of the disease.

30873683,Tumour biomarkers-Tracing the molecular function and clinical implication.,"In recent years, with the increase in cancer mortality caused by metastasis, and with the development of individualized and precise medical treatment, early diagnosis with precision becomes the key to decrease the death rate. Since detecting tumour biomarkers in body fluids is the most non-invasive way to identify the status of tumour development, it has been widely investigated for the usage in clinic. These biomarkers include different expression or mutation in microRNAs (miRNAs), circulating tumour DNAs (ctDNAs), proteins, exosomes and circulating tumour cells (CTCs). In the present article, we summarized and discussed some updated research on these biomarkers. We overviewed their biological functions and evaluated their multiple roles in human and small animal clinical treatment, including diagnosis of cancers, classification of cancers, prognostic and predictive values for therapy response, monitors for therapy efficacy, and anti-cancer therapeutics. Biomarkers including different expression or mutation in miRNAs, ctDNAs, proteins, exosomes and CTCs provide more choice for early diagnosis of tumour detection at early stage before metastasis. Combination detection of these tumour biomarkers may provide higher accuracy at the lowest molecule combination number for tumour early detection.

31350202,Next Generation Sequencing Reveals Novel Mutations in Mismatch Repair Genes and Other Cancer Predisposition Genes in Asian Patients with Suspected Lynch Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Although at least 5 genes are implicated in Lynch Syndrome (LS), up to 50% of suspected cases are owing to undefined genes. We utilized next generation sequencing (NGS) to characterize the mutation profile of patients with cancer (CA) suspected to have LS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 174 Asian patients with CA from our CA Genetics Clinic from 2000 to 2014 suspected to have LS, and obtained germline DNA for NGS using TruSight Cancer. Frameshift, nonsense, and known deleterious mutations were considered pathogenic. Polymorphisms <= 1% frequency in 1000 Genomes (Asian) were classified using established databases. RESULTS: Of the 174 probands, 80.5% were Chinese, the median age at CA diagnosis was 45 years (range, 18-82 years), and 84.5% and 8.6% had colon and LS-like CA, respectively. Forty-seven of 100 evaluable colon CA probands had LS-like histopathologic features. Nineteen of 174 had family history fulfilling Amsterdam I/II Criteria, whereas the rest fulfilled Bethesda Guidelines. Thirty-one of 174 harbored pathogenic mutations with 10 in LS genes only, 20 in non-LS genes only, and 1 in both. Of the 11 with LS gene mutations, MLH1 was most commonly involved (n = 7), followed by MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Nine of 174 had pathogenic mutations diagnostic of alternative hereditary syndromes including 2 each in CDH1, APC, and BRCA1, and 1 each in BRCA2, SMAD4, and MUTYH. Ten unique mutations were detected in low-to-moderate penetrance genes: 6 individuals had a recurring novel KIT:c.2836C>T nonsense mutation (n = 3) or ERCC4:c.2169C>A nonsense mutation (n = 3) without LS gene mutation, which is of clinical interest.

31292799,Double heterozygous mutation in the BRCA1 and ATM genes involved in development of primary metachronous tumours: a case report.,"PURPOSE: Between 5 and 10% of cases of breast cancer (BC) are attributable to a genetic susceptibility. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes described in the late 1990s are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, and the clinical management of carriers of pathogenic variants in these genes is defined in several clinical guidelines (Paluch-Shimon et al. in Ann Oncol 27(suppl 5):v103-v110, 2016; Llort et al. in Clin Transl Oncol 17(12):956-961, 2015).

METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 189 surgically resected LUSC. TMB was defined as the sum of nonsynonymous single nucleotide and indel variants. CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density and PD-L1 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Six immune infiltrates were estimated using an online database. RESULTS: The median TMB was 9.43 mutations per megabase. Positive PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TILs density were identified in 24.3% and 78.8%. PIK3CA amplification was associated with significantly higher TMB (P = 0.036). Frequent genetic alterations had no impact on PD-L1 expression but PIK3CA amplification and KEAP1 mutation were independently associated with significantly lower CD8+ TIL density (P < 0.001, P = 0.005, respectively). Low TMB and high CD8+ TIL density were independently associated with longer disease-free survival (DFS) while none of them could individually predict the overall survival (OS). Combination of TMB and PD-L1 expression or TMB and CD8+ TIL density could stratify total populations into two groups with distinct prognosis. Classifying tumor-immune microenvironment based on PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TIL density showed discrepant genomic alterations but similar TMB, clinical features, and OS. Notably, patients with different smoking status had distinct prognostic factors.

Targeted deletion of the RORgammat transcription factor or blockade of the JAK2-STAT3 axis suppresses IL-17 production and alloreactivity by Th17 cells. Here, we show that pSTAT3 Y705 is increased significantly in CD4(+) T cells among human recipients of allogeneic HCT before the onset of Grade II-IV acute GVHD. Examination of target-organ tissues at the time of GVHD diagnosis indicates that the amount of RORgammat + Th17 cells is significantly higher in severe GVHD. Greater accumulation of tissue-resident Th17 cells also correlates with the use of MTX- compared with Rapa-based GVHD prophylaxis, as well as a poor therapeutic response to glucocorticoids. RORgammat is optimally suppressed by concurrent neutralization of TORC1 with Rapa and inhibition of STAT3 activation with S3I-201, supporting that mTOR- and STAT3-dependent pathways converge upon RORgammat gene expression.

The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of continence after AMS placement in patients who had postoperative urinary retention as compared with those patients who did not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent AMS placement for PPI between 2008 and 2011 with postoperative void trial (TOV). Preoperative factors such as urodynamic findings, daily pad number (PPD) and weight were recorded. Follow up data included pad use, need for catheterization and complications. Statistical analysis compared patients with and without postoperative urinary retention. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included with a mean follow up of 11.8 months. Complete continence was 60%, while 83% of patients were improved. PPD improved from 2.9 pads to 0.8 pads after AMS placement. Sixteen patients (46%) had postoperative urinary retention requiring clean intermittent catheterization (CIC).

The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of continence after AMS placement in patients who had postoperative urinary retention as compared with those patients who did not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent AMS placement for PPI between 2008 and 2011 with postoperative void trial (TOV). Preoperative factors such as urodynamic findings, daily pad number (PPD) and weight were recorded. Follow up data included pad use, need for catheterization and complications. Statistical analysis compared patients with and without postoperative urinary retention. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included with a mean follow up of 11.8 months.

The median age was 42 years old (ranged from 14 to 72 years old) . The chemotherapy regimens were used for induction therapy and all cases were followed up. The treatment response was evaluated by MICM and the comparison of the ratio were analyzed by chi-square test and the survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. Results: There were 52 FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with favorable prognosis genes (46 cases with NPM1, 5 cases with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, 1 case with CEBPA double mutation) and 62 patients with other types of FLT3-ITD(+)AML at diagnosis. All patients completed at least one cycle of induction therapy and the clinical curative effect was evaluated, complete remission (CR) rate was 50.0% (57/114) in one cycle and total CR rate was 72.5% (74/104) in two cycles. The CR rate of the FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients with favorable prognosis genes was 67.3% (35/52) in one cycle and 83.3% (40/48) in two cycles; for the other types FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients, the CR rate was 35.5% (22/62) in one cycle and 64.8% (35/54) in two cycles. There was a significant difference in CR rate between the FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with and without favorable prognosis genes (P<0.05) . This indicates that the FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with favorable prognosis gene had relatively good therapeutic effect.

31515871,Cryptic recurrent ACIN1-NUTM1 fusions in non-KMT2A-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) are rare hematological malignancies occurring in children younger than 1 year of age, most frequently associated with KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2A-r). The smaller subset without KMT2A-r, which represents 20% of infant ALL cases, is poorly characterized. Here we report two cases of chemotherapy-sensitive non-KMT2A-r infant ALL. Transcriptome analyses revealed identical ACIN1-NUTM1 gene fusions in both cases, derived from cryptic chromosomal rearrangements undetected by standard cytogenetic approaches. Two isoforms of the gene fusion, joining exons 3 or 4 of ACIN1 to exon 3 of NUTM1, were identified. Both fusion transcripts contained the functional DNA-binding SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) domain of ACIN1 and most of NUTM1. The detection of the ACIN1-NUTM1 fusion by RT-PCR allowed the molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease in a clinical setting. Based on publicly available genomic datasets and literature review, we predict that NUTM1 gene fusions are recurrent events in infant ALL. As such, we propose two clinically relevant assays to screen for NUTM1 rearrangements in bone marrow cells, independent of the fusion partner: NUMT1 immunohistochemistry and NUTM1 RNA expression. In sum, our study identifies ACIN1-NUTM1 as a recurrent and possibly cryptic fusion in non-KMT2A-r infant ALL, provides clinical tools to screen for NUTM1-rearranged leukemia and contributes to the refinement of this new subgroup.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31515871.txt,1,"Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) are rare hematological malignancies occurring in children younger than 1 year of age, most frequently associated with KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2A-r).

38416462,Novel Polygenic Risk Score and Established Clinical Risk Factors for Risk Estimation of Aortic Stenosis.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have proven to be as strong as or stronger than established clinical risk factors for many cardiovascular phenotypes. Whether this is true for aortic stenosis remains unknown.
To develop a novel aortic stenosis PRS and compare its aortic stenosis risk estimation to established clinical risk factors.
This was a longitudinal cohort study using data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP; 2011-2020), UK Biobank (2006-2010), and 6 Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trials, including DECLARE-TIMI 58 (2013-2018), FOURIER (TIMI 59; 2013-2017), PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (2010-2014), SAVOR-TIMI 53 (2010-2013), SOLID-TIMI 52 (2009-2014), and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 58 (2008-2013), which were a mix of population-based and randomized clinical trials. Individuals from UK Biobank and the MVP meeting a previously validated case/control definition for aortic stenosis were included. All individuals from TIMI trials were included unless they had a documented preexisting aortic valve replacement. Analysis took place from January 2022 to December 2023.
PRS for aortic stenosis (developed using data from MVP and validated in UK Biobank) and other previously validated cardiovascular PRSs, defined either as a continuous variable or as low (bottom 20%), intermediate, and high (top 20%), and clinical risk factors.
Aortic stenosis (defined using International Classification of Diseases or Current Procedural Terminology codes in UK Biobank and MVP or safety event data in the TIMI trials).
The median (IQR) age in MVP was 67 (57-73) years, and 135 140 of 147 104 participants (92%) were male. The median (IQR) age in the TIMI trials was 66 (54-78) years, and 45 524 of 59 866 participants (71%) were male. The best aortic stenosis PRS incorporated 5 170 041 single-nucleotide variants and was associated with aortic stenosis in both the MVP testing sample (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.37-1.45 per 1 SD PRS; P = 4.6 × 10-116) and TIMI trials (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.27-1.62 per 1 SD PRS; P = 3.2 × 10-9). Among genetic and clinical risk factors, the aortic stenosis PRS performed comparably to most risk factors besides age, and within a given age range, the combination of clinical and genetic risk factors was additive, providing a 3- to 4-fold increased gradient of risk of aortic stenosis. However, the addition of the aortic stenosis PRS to a model including clinical risk factors only improved risk discrimination of aortic stenosis by 0.01 to 0.02 (C index in MVP: 0.78 with clinical risk factors, 0.79 with risk factors and aortic stenosis PRS; C index in TIMI: 0.71 with clinical risk factors, 0.73 with risk factors and aortic stenosis PRS).

Whether this is true for aortic stenosis remains unknown. To develop a novel aortic stenosis PRS and compare its aortic stenosis risk estimation to established clinical risk factors. This was a longitudinal cohort study using data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP; 2011-2020), UK Biobank (2006-2010), and 6 Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trials, including DECLARE-TIMI 58 (2013-2018), FOURIER (TIMI 59; 2013-2017), PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (2010-2014), SAVOR-TIMI 53 (2010-2013), SOLID-TIMI 52 (2009-2014), and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 58 (2008-2013), which were a mix of population-based and randomized clinical trials. Individuals from UK Biobank and the MVP meeting a previously validated casecontrol definition for aortic stenosis were included. All individuals from TIMI trials were included unless they had a documented preexisting aortic valve replacement. Analysis took place from January 2022 to December 2023. PRS for aortic stenosis (developed using data from MVP and validated in UK Biobank) and other previously validated cardiovascular PRSs, defined either as a continuous variable or as low (bottom 20), intermediate, and high (top 20), and clinical risk factors. Aortic stenosis (defined using International Classification of Diseases or Current Procedural Terminology codes in UK Biobank and MVP or safety event data in the TIMI trials). The median (IQR) age in MVP was 67 (57-73) years, and 135 140 of 147 104 participants (92) were male. The median (IQR) age in the TIMI trials was 66 (54-78) years, and 45 524 of 59 866 participants (71) were male. The best aortic stenosis PRS incorporated 5 170 041 single-nucleotide variants and was associated with aortic stenosis in both the MVP testing sample (odds ratio, 1.41; 95 CI, 1.37-1.45 per 1 SD PRS; P  4.6  10-116) and TIMI trials (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95 CI, 1.27-1.62 per 1 SD PRS; P  3.2  10-9). Among genetic and clinical risk factors, the aortic stenosis PRS performed comparably to most risk factors besides age, and within a given age range, the combination of clinical and genetic risk factors was additive, providing a 3- to 4-fold increased gradient of risk of aortic stenosis. However, the addition of the aortic stenosis PRS to a model including clinical risk factors only improved risk discrimination of aortic stenosis by 0.01 to 0.02 (C index in MVP: 0.78 with clinical risk factors, 0.79 with risk factors and aortic stenosis PRS; C index in TIMI: 0.71 with clinical risk factors, 0.73 with risk factors and aortic stenosis PRS).

ULK is a key kinase in autophagy initiation, but whether ULK kinase activity also participates in the late stages of autophagy remains unknown. Here, we found that the autophagosomal SNARE protein, STX17, is phosphorylated by ULK at residue S289, beyond which it localizes specifically to autophagosomes. Inhibition of STX17 phosphorylation prevents such autophagosome localization. FLNA was then identified as a linker between ATG8 family proteins (ATG8s) and STX17 with essential involvement in STX17 recruitment to autophagosomes. Phosphorylation of STX17 S289 promotes its interaction with FLNA, activating its recruitment to autophagosomes and facilitating autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Disease-causative mutations around the ATG8s- and STX17-binding regions of FLNA disrupt its interactions with ATG8s and STX17, inhibiting STX17 recruitment and autophagosome-lysosome fusion.

Those recommendations included both pathogenic (PP1) and benign (BS4) criteria for evaluating the inheritance patterns of variants, but details of how to apply those criteria at appropriate evidence levels were sparse. Several publications have since attempted to provide additional guidance, but anecdotally, this issue is still challenging. Additionally, it is not clear that those prior efforts fully distinguished disease-gene identification considerations from variant pathogenicity considerations nor did they address autosomal-recessive and X-linked inheritance. Here, we have taken a mixed inductive and deductive approach to this problem using real diseases as examples. We have developed a practical heuristic for genetic co-segregation evidence and have also determined that the specific phenotype criterion (PP4) is inseparably coupled to the co-segregation criterion. We have also determined that negative evidence at one locus constitutes positive evidence for other loci for disorders with locus heterogeneity. Finally, we provide a points-based system for evaluating phenotype and co-segregation as evidence types to support or refute a locus and show how that can be integrated into the Bayesian framework now used for variant classification and consistent with the 2015 guidelines.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\38103548.txt,0,"The 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology variant classification publication established a standard employed internationally to guide laboratories in variant assessment.

Clinically, autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease is characterized by vast heterogeneity, ranging from asymptomatic to highly symptomatic hepatomegaly. To date, little is known about the prediction of disease progression at early stages, hindering clinical management, genetic counseling, and the design of randomized controlled trials. To improve disease prognostication, we built a consortium of European and US centers to recruit the largest cohort of patients with PRKCSH and SEC63 liver disease.
We analyzed an international multicenter cohort of 265 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease harboring pathogenic variants in PRKCSH or SEC63 for genotype-phenotype correlations, including normalized age-adjusted total liver volumes and polycystic liver disease-related hospitalization (liver event) as primary clinical end points.
Classifying individual total liver volumes into predefined progression groups yielded predictive risk discrimination for future liver events independent of sex and underlying genetic defects. In addition, disease severity, defined by age at first liver event, was considerably more pronounced in female patients and patients with PRKCSH variants than in those with SEC63 variants. A newly developed sex-gene score was effective in distinguishing mild, moderate, and severe disease, in addition to imaging-based prognostication.

Mitochondrial morphology and subcellular structure were determined by transmission electron and immunofluorescent microscopies. Mitochondrial metabolism was determined by mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate. SUMOylation and protein interaction were determined by immunoprecipitation.
The involvement of SENP1 (sentrin-specific protease 1)-mediated SUMOylation in mitochondrial remodeling in the pulmonary endothelium was identified in clinical specimens of hypoxia-related PH and was verified in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells under hypoxia. Further analyses in clinical specimens, hypoxic rat and mouse PH models, and human pulmonary artery endothelial cells and human embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells revealed that short-term hypoxia-induced SENP1 translocation to endothelial mitochondria to regulate deSUMOylation of mitochondrial fission protein FIS1 (mitochondrial fission 1), which facilitated FIS1 assembling with fusion protein MFN2 (mitofusin 2) and mitochondrial gatekeeper VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel 1), and the membrane tethering activity of MFN2 by enhancing its oligomerization. Consequently, FIS1 deSUMOylation maintained the mitochondrial integrity and endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria calcium communication across mitochondrial-associated membranes, subsequently preserving pulmonary endothelial function and vascular homeostasis. In contrast, prolonged hypoxia disabled the FIS1 deSUMOylation by diminishing the availability of SENP1 in mitochondria via inducing miR-138 and consequently resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming in pulmonary endothelium. Functionally, introduction of viral-packaged deSUMOylated FIS1 within pulmonary endothelium in mice improved pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and hypoxic PH development, while knock-in of SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier)-conjugated FIS1 in mice exaggerated the diseased cellular and tissue phenotypes.
By maintaining endothelial mitochondrial homeostasis, deSUMOylation of FIS1 adaptively preserves pulmonary endothelial function against hypoxic stress and consequently protects against PH.

24777453,Rare and low-frequency coding variants in CXCR2 and other genes are associated with hematological traits.,"Hematological traits are important clinical parameters. To test the effects of rare and low-frequency coding variants on hematological traits, we analyzed hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit levels, white blood cell (WBC) counts and platelet counts in 31,340 individuals genotyped on an exome array. We identified several missense variants in CXCR2 associated with reduced WBC count (gene-based P = 2.6 x 10(-13)). In a separate family-based resequencing study, we identified a CXCR2 frameshift mutation in a pedigree with congenital neutropenia that abolished ligand-induced CXCR2 signal transduction and chemotaxis. We also identified missense or splice-site variants in key hematopoiesis regulators (EPO, TFR2, HBB, TUBB1 and SH2B3) associated with blood cell traits. Finally, we were able to detect associations between a rare somatic JAK2 mutation (encoding p.Val617Phe) and platelet count (P = 3.9 x 10(-22)) as well as hemoglobin concentration (P = 0.002), hematocrit levels (P = 9.5 x 10(-7)) and WBC count (P = 3.1 x 10(-5)).

Although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown, components involved in DNA mismatch repair, particularly mismatch recognition protein MutSbeta (a MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer), are implicated in (CAG) (CTG) repeat expansion. In addition to recognizing small insertion-deletion loop-outs, MutSbeta also specifically binds DNA hairpin imperfect heteroduplexes formed within (CAG)n (CTG)n sequences. However, whether or not and how MutSbeta binding triggers expansion of (CAG) (CTG) repeats remain unknown. We show here that purified recombinant MutSbeta physically interacts with DNA polymerase beta (Polbeta) and stimulates Polbeta-catalyzed (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpin retention. Consistent with these in vitro observations, MutSbeta and Polbeta interact with each other in vivo, and colocalize at (CAG) (CTG) repeats during DNA replication. Our data support a model for error-prone processing of (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins by MutSbeta and Polbeta during DNA replication and/or repair: MutSbeta recognizes (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins formed in the nascent DNA strand, and recruits Polbeta to the complex, which then utilizes the hairpin as a primer for extension, leading to (CAG) (CTG) repeat expansion.

The durability of responses and long-term safety of this drug in patients with polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia have not been reported. Here, we present long-term efficacy and safety data from a single-centre, open-label, phase 2 trial, after a median of 83 months follow up. METHODS: Patients older than 18 years who were diagnosed with essential thrombocythaemia or polycythaemia vera according to 2001 WHO criteria were eligible to enrol in our study. The initial starting dose of pegylated interferon alfa-2a was 450 mug subcutaneously once per week, but was decreased in a stepwise manner due to toxic effects to a final starting dose of 90 mg per week: three patients were started at a dose of 450 mg per week, three at 360 mg per week, 19 at 270 mg per week, 26 at 180 mg per week, and 32 at 90 mg per week. Treatment was continued for as long as the patients derived clinical benefit with reductions in dose and frequency of administration allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. Haematological responses were assessed every 3-6 months on the basis of blood counts as defined by the European LeukemiaNet critieria. The primary endpoint of the initial study was the proportion of patients with a haematological response. Complete haematological response was defined as normalisation of blood counts (for patients with essential thrombocythaemia, platelets <=440 x 109 per L; for patients with polycythaemia vera, haemoglobin <15 0 g/L without phlebotomy) with complete resolution of palpable splenomegaly or symptoms in the absence of a thrombotic event. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics and in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00452023 and is ongoing but not enrolling new patients. FINDINGS: Between May 21, 2005, and Dec 1, 2015, patients were followed up for a median of 83 months (IQR 69-94 months). Pegylated interferon alfa-2a induced haematological (66 [80%] of 83 patients) and molecular responses (35 [63%] of 55 patients) in 40 patients with essential thrombocythaemia and 43 patients with polycythaemia vera, with median durations of 66 months (IQR 35-83) and 53 months (24-70), respectively. 26 (39%) of 66 haematological responders and 25 (71%) of 35 molecular responders (with the JAK2 Val617Phe mutation) have maintained some response during follow-up: 49% maintained their best molecular response (nine of ten patients who had a complete response, five of 20 who had a partial response, and three of five who had a minor response). The incidence of major venous-thrombotic events during the study was 1 22 per 100 person-years. Overall, 18 (22%) of 83 patients discontinued therapy due to treatment-related toxicity. Although toxicity rates decreased over time, five patients had treatment-limiting grade 3 or 4 toxicities after 60 months on therapy. 32 patients are still enrolled on the study.

31479615,The Origin and Pathogenesis of Endometriosis.,"Recent molecular genetic findings on endometriosis and normal endometrium suggest a modified model in which circulating epithelial progenitor or stem cells intended to regenerate uterine endometrium after menstruation may become overreactive and trapped outside the uterus. These trapped epithelium-committed progenitor cells form nascent glands through clonal expansion and recruit polyclonal stromal cells, leading to the establishment of deep infiltrating endometriosis. Once formed, the ectopic tissue becomes subject to immune surveillance, resulting in chronic inflammation. The inflammatory response orchestrated by nuclear factor-kappaB signaling is exacerbated by aberrations in the estrogen receptor-beta and progesterone receptor pathways, which are also affected by local inflammation, forming a dysregulated inflammation-hormonal loop. Glandular epithelium within endometriotic tissue harbors cancer-associated mutations that are frequently detected in endometriosis-related ovarian cancers.

Immunohistochemical prognostic factors [estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2), p53 mutation, Ki-67 proliferation index] and histological grades were determined. Standardized uptake value (SUV)-based, volume-based, and radiomics findings were obtained from F-FDG PET/CT images. RESULTS: In cases of ER and PR negativity, Her-2 positivity, presence of the p53 mutation, and Ki-67 index of at least 20% patients, total volumetric parameters were significantly higher in paired comparisons. The results of the ER-negative group were significantly higher than those of ER-positive patients in GLRLM_GLNU, GLRLM_RLNU, GLZLM_GLNU, and GLZLM_ZLNU comparisons. In grade 3 patients, mean SUV, maximum SUV, and GLRLM_LRHGE values were higher than those of grade 2 patients.

36857646,Rational design of nonlinear hybridization immunosensor chain reactions for simultaneous ultrasensitive detection of two tumor marker proteins.,"Sensitive biomarker detection techniques are beneficial for both disease diagnosis and postoperative examinations. The nonlinear hybridization chain reaction (NHCR) is widely used as an output signal amplification technique for biosensor platforms. A novel hairpin-free NHCR was developed in this study as a flow cytometric immunoassay to detect alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and prostate specific antigen (PSA). First, the target AFP is captured on magnetic beads (MBs) that are modified with capture antibodies. Then, the prepared biotin-streptavidin-biotin (B-S-B) system, which links biotinylated detection antibodies and biotinylated trigger DNA together through the high affinity between biotin-streptavidin interaction, is added to label the target AFP, forming a sandwich complex with three trigger DNA chains. Each trigger DNA chain grows a dendritic DNA nanostructure following a nonlinear hybridization chain reaction. As the substrate flue chains are labeled with fluorophores, the self-assembly process of dendritic DNA is accompanied by the continuous release of fluorophores. Dendrites with strong fluorescence then form on the surface of MBs. Finally, the target AFP is quantified by analyzing the fluorescent MBs using flow cytometry. The proposed immunoassay has a high selectivity along with isothermal, enzyme-free, and exponential amplification efficiency. It shows a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.74 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The proposed biosensor was also successfully used to quantitatively detect AFP in serum samples.

AT outcomes after AS were evaluable in 65 lesions, and 49 (75) lesions did not require a transition to a second AT. AS was revealed as an effective treatment modality. The transition to AT needs to be considered for neck location and CTNNB1 S45F mutation DF. Good results can be obtained by selecting a treatment method that considers the tumor location even in cases that require intervention.",['tumor'],1

36929593,Large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumour: molecular and immunohistochemical assessment of a series comprising non-metastasising and metastasising neoplasms.,"Large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumour (LCCSCT) is a type of testicular sex cord-stromal tumour that may occur sporadically or in the context of Carney complex and other genetic syndromes. A subset is clinically malignant, and the molecular mechanisms that drive such aggressive behaviour remain unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 21 samples from 20 patients with LCCSCT (12 non-metastasising and eight metastasising) using PRKAR1A immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing. All tumours except two (cases 17 and 20, both metastasising) demonstrated loss of PRKAR1A expression. Among 11 cases with interpretable sequencing results, all harboured pathogenic single nucleotide variants of PRKAR1A. Evidence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of PRKAR1A was present in all tumours with interpretable zygosity data, but the mechanisms of LOH were different for non-metastasising and metastasising tumours. Non-metastasising tumours demonstrated only copy-neutral LOH, while metastasising tumours demonstrated a spectrum of mechanisms of LOH, including copy-loss LOH, two concurrent mutations or copy-neutral LOH. Relevant molecular findings in non-metastasising LCCSCT were limited to PRKAR1A variants. In contrast, all metastasising LCCSCTs with interpretable data harboured additional pathogenic variants, including (but not restricted to) BRCA2 mutations with evidence of LOH and bi-allelic CDKN2A/B deletions. Three patients harboured PRKAR1A variants of inferred germline origin, including one with Carney complex and two without known syndromic features. CONCLUSIONS: This study further confirms that PRKAR1A IHC is a useful diagnostic tool for both non-metastasising and metastasising tumours and suggests that molecular analyses can be helpful to identify non-metastasising tumours with malignant potential in selected patients. Importantly, these results highlight that germline assessment could be beneficial for all patients presenting with LCCSCT.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\36929593.txt,1,"Large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumour (LCCSCT) is a type of testicular sex cord-stromal tumour that may occur sporadically or in the context of Carney complex and other genetic syndromes.

Genetic factors, other than EGFR sensitive mutations, that allow prognosis of TKI treatment remain undefined. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 423 consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR 19del or 21L858R mutations. A total of 71 patients whose progression-free survivals (PFS) were shorter than 6 months or longer than 24 months were included and stratified into separate groups. Genetic background discrepancy was analysed in the two groups using next generation sequencing (NGS). FINDINGS: Sensitive EGFR mutations of 19del or 21L858R were detected by NGS in all patients; the 21L858R mutation was the major type. The most frequent accompanying somatic mutations were TP53, RB1, MAP2K. ALK fusion, MET amplification, and BRAF V600E were found only in the short PFS group. Concurrent pretreament T790 M mutation was found in both groups, but was proportionally higher in the short PFS group.

31046485,Circulating cell-free nucleic acids as biomarkers in colorectal cancer screening and diagnosis - an update.,"Introduction: Screening methods for one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancy, colorectal cancer (CRC), have limitations. Circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNA) hold clinical relevance as screening, prognostic and therapy monitoring markers. Area covered: In this review, we summarize potential CRC-specific cfNA biomarkers, the recently developed sample preparation techniques, their applications, and pitfalls. Expert opinion: Automated extraction of cfDNA is highly reproducible, however, cfDNA yield is less compared to manual isolation. Quantitative and highly sensitive detection techniques (e.g. digital PCR, NGS) can be applied to analyze genetic and epigenetic changes. Detection of DNA mutations or methylation in cfDNA and related altered levels of mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA may improve early cancer recognition, based on specific, CRC-related patterns. Detection of cfDNA mutations (e.g. TP53, KRAS, APC) has limited diagnostic sensitivity (40-60%), however, methylated DNA including SEPT9, SFRP1, SDC2 can be applied with higher sensitivity (up to 90%) for CRC. Circulating miRNAs (e.g. miR-21, miR-92, miR-141) provide comparably high sensitivity for CRC as the circulating tumor cell mRNA markers (e.g. EGFR, CK19, CK20, CEA).

29549173,Clinical spectrum of pyruvate kinase deficiency: data from the Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Natural History Study.,"An international, multicenter registry was established to collect retrospective and prospective clinical data on patients with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, the most common glycolytic defect causing congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Medical history and laboratory and radiologic data were retrospectively collected at enrollment for 254 patients with molecularly confirmed PK deficiency. Perinatal complications were common, including anemia that required transfusions, hyperbilirubinemia, hydrops, and prematurity. Nearly all newborns were treated with phototherapy (93%), and many were treated with exchange transfusions (46%). Children age 5 years and younger were often transfused until splenectomy. Splenectomy (150 [59%] of 254 patients) was associated with a median increase in hemoglobin of 1.6 g/dL and a decreased transfusion burden in 90% of patients. Predictors of a response to splenectomy included higher presplenectomy hemoglobin (P = .007), lower indirect bilirubin (P = .005), and missense PKLR mutations (P = .0017). Postsplenectomy thrombosis was reported in 11% of patients. The most frequent complications included iron overload (48%) and gallstones (45%), but other complications such as aplastic crises, osteopenia/bone fragility, extramedullary hematopoiesis, postsplenectomy sepsis, pulmonary hypertension, and leg ulcers were not uncommon. Overall, 87 (34%) of 254 patients had both a splenectomy and cholecystectomy. In those who had a splenectomy without simultaneous cholecystectomy, 48% later required a cholecystectomy. Although the risk of complications increases with severity of anemia and a genotype-phenotype relationship was observed, complications were common in all patients with PK deficiency.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data from 187 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. The prevalence, progression, and potential relationship between liver lesions and other clinical findings, including genetic associations, were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 187 patients (14.9%) had hepatic lesions. There was a predominance of female over male patients in individuals with liver lesions (17 versus 11), with statistical significance in patients under five years of age (P < 0.05). All individuals having hepatic lesions who also had available genetic testing data (n = 20) were diagnosed with a TSC2 gene mutation. All patients with liver lesions had coexisting renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) (P < 0.05). The age of onset of renal lesions was lower and their prevalence was significantly higher in patients with liver involvement (P < 0.05). In most instances, hepatic lesions measured several millimeters in diameter and were clinically asymptomatic.

30900517,Successful role of adjuvant radiotherapy in a rare case of tracheal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare benign cancer that can express a more aggressive phenotype related to the genetic mutation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase receptor (ALK). Involvement of trachea is extremely rare and due to the clinical and radiologic nonspecificity, the definitive diagnosis is based on the histologic evaluation of tissue specimens. Total surgical excision is curative and chemotherapy or radiotherapy has been employed in the treatment of unresectable tumors or as adjuvant therapies. CASE PRESENTATION: The case described here is being reported because of the rare tracheal location and the atypical treatment approach used for an ALK-positive IMT. A 7-week pregnant woman voluntary interrupted pregnancy and underwent total surgical excision that resulted to have close margins. Although ALK-positive expression indicated the use of ALK inhibitors, she refused any type of adjuvant therapy that could affect ovarian function.

Involvement of trachea is extremely rare and due to the clinical and radiologic nonspecificity, the definitive diagnosis is based on the histologic evaluation of tissue specimens. Total surgical excision is curative and chemotherapy or radiotherapy has been employed in the treatment of unresectable tumors or as adjuvant therapies. CASE PRESENTATION: The case described here is being reported because of the rare tracheal location and the atypical treatment approach used for an ALK-positive IMT. A 7-week pregnant woman voluntary interrupted pregnancy and underwent total surgical excision that resulted to have close margins. Although ALK-positive expression indicated the use of ALK inhibitors, she refused any type of adjuvant therapy that could affect ovarian function. Thus, 3D conformational external beam radiotherapy was performed with a daily dose of 180 cGy, 5 times per week, up to 45 Gy at the level of trachea. A total of 62 months of follow-up showed and no signs of disease recurrence or late radiation therapy-related toxicity.

31054046,Osteosarcoma and second malignant neoplasms: a case series.,"BACKGROUND: The overall survival of patients with localised osteosarcoma has dramatically improved with the introduction of multidrug chemotherapeutic regimens into the treatment paradigm. However, despite optimal treatment, all-cause mortality remains higher among osteosarcoma survivors than in the general population. The development of second malignant neoplasms contributes to this higher mortality rate. CASE SERIES: We present three cases of patients definitively treated for osteosarcoma who subsequently developed a second malignant neoplasm. The first case describes a 17-year-old female with osteosarcoma of her right femur treated with surgical resection and perioperative chemotherapy. Ten years later, she was diagnosed with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Genetic testing identified a germline TP53 mutation, confirming the presence of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The second case details an 18-year-old male with osteosarcoma of his right humerus treated with definitive resection and perioperative chemotherapy. He was diagnosed with appendiceal adenocarcinoma after presenting with acute abdominal pain 17 years later. The third case reviewed is of a 36-year-old male with osteosarcoma of his right femur treated with definitive resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. A diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was made 7 years later following surveillance imaging.

The present study aimed to shed light on the mechanism by which bile acid stimulation causes cancer onset and progression. Metabolomics analyses were performed on samples of neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissues from reflux models, and K14D, cultivated from a nonmetastatic, primary ESCC, and ESCC-DR, established from a metastatic thoracic lesion. ESCC-DRtca2M was prepared by treating ESCC-DR cells with taurocholic acid (TCA) to accelerate cancer progression. The lines were subjected to comprehensive genomic analyses. In addition, protein expression levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) (p65) and O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) were compared among lines. Cancers developed in the reflux models exhibited greater hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) activation compared with the nonneoplastic tissues. Expression of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) increased considerably in both ESCC and EAC compared with nonneoplastic squamous epithelium. Conversely, cell line-based experiments revealed the greater activation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) at higher degrees of malignancy. G6PD overexpression in response to TCA exposure was observed. Both NF-kappaB (p65) and O-GlcNAc were expressed more highly in ESCC-DRtca2M than in the other cell lines. Moreover, ESCC-DRtca2M cells had additional chromosomal abnormalities in excess of ESCC-DR cells. Overall, glucose metabolism was upregulated in both esophageal cancer tissue and cell lines.

31681608,Epigenetic Targets in Synovial Sarcoma: A Mini-Review.,"Synovial Sarcomas (SS) are a type of Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) and represent 8-10% of all STS cases. Although SS can arise at any age, it typically affects younger individuals aged 15-35 and is therefore part of both pediatric and adult clinical practices. SS occurs primarily in the limbs, often near joints, but can present anywhere. It is characterized by the recurrent pathognomonic chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) that most frequently fuses SSX1 or SSX2 genes with SS18. This leads to the expression of the SS18-SSX fusion protein, which causes disturbances in several interacting multiprotein complexes such as the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex, also known as the BAF complex and the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). Furthermore, this promotes widespread epigenetic rewiring, leading to aberrant gene expression that drives the pathogenesis of SS. Good prognoses are characterized predominantly by small tumor size and young patient age. Whereas, high tumor grade and an increased genomic complexity of the tumor constitute poor prognostic factors. The current therapeutic strategy relies on chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the latter of which can lead to chronic side effects for pediatric patients.

37402998,Inhibition of TMEM16A improves cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury via preventing DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our previous study has demonstrated that TMEM16A, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated chloride channel, contributes to renal fibrosis progression in chronic kidney disease. However, whether TMEM16A is involved in AKI is still unknown. In this study, we established cisplatin AKI mice model and found that TMEM16A expression was upregulated in the injured kidney. In vivo knockdown of TMEM16A effectively prevented cisplatin-induced tubular cell apoptosis, inflammation and kidney function loss. Western blot and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that TMEM16A knockdown inhibited Drp1 translocation from the cytoplasm to mitochondria and prevented mitochondrial fission in tubular cells. Consistently, in cultured HK2 cells, knockdown or inhibition of TMEM16A by shRNA or its specific inhibitor suppressed cisplatin-induced mitochondrial fission and its associated energy dysfunction, ROS accumulation, and cell apoptosis via inhibiting Drp1 activation. Further investigation showed that genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of TMEM16A inhibited cisplatin-induced Drp1 Ser-616 site phosphorylation through ERK1/2 signaling pathway, whereas overexpression of TMEM16A promoted this effect. Treatment with Drp1 or ERK1/2 inhibitor could efficiently prevent cisplatin-induced mitochondrial fission.

30885334,A study of ALK-positive pulmonary squamous-cell carcinoma: From diagnostic methodologies to clinical efficacy.,"BACKGROUND: High concordance has been observed between Ventana D5F3 ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). However, whether a similar conclusion can be applied to lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LSCC) has remained unclear. We therefore evaluated the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) status and the therapeutic effect of an ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in IHC- or FISH-positive LSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2403 LSCC patients from three institutions were screened for ALK aberration by IHC. All IHC-positive cases were subjected to FISH (with an approximately equal number of negative cases as a control group) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Clinical efficacy was evaluated for the patients who received TKI therapy. RESULTS: In 2403 cases of LSCC, 37 cases were identified as ALK-positive by IHC. After quality control, 28 cases were succeeded by FISH (six with insufficient tissue, three with lack of signals) and 13 by NGS (24 failed due to insufficient samples or poor DNA quality); the percentage of non-diagnostic tests was 24.3% (9/37) and 64.9% (24/37), respectively. Four cases (4/2394, 0.17%) analyzed by FISH were determined as ALK-positive. For the control group (40 ALK IHC), FISH demonstrated no samples with ALK gene fusion. The concordance between ALK IHC- and ALK FISH-positive results was 14.3% (4/28). In the 13 cases studied by NGS, two cases showed ALK-EML4 fusion (consistent with two FISH-positive results), and two cases were interpreted as harboring an ALK-association gene mutation. Among four patients (two FISH-positive and two IHC-positive only cases) receiving TKI therapy, two patients had stable disease and the other two had progressive disease.

Therefore, ALK IHC detection in LSCC cannot be used as a diagnostic method for ALK rearrangement.","['lymphoma', 'carcinoma']",1
30009677,Generation of CD34 Fluorescent Reporter Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Monitoring Hematopoietic Differentiation.,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold great promise for disease modeling, drug screens, and eventually cell therapy approaches. During in vitro differentiation of hiPSCs into hematoendothelial progenitors, the emergence of CD34-positive cells indicates a critical step of lineage specification. To facilitate the monitoring of hematopoietic differentiation of hiPSCs, we established fluorescent reporter cells for the stem and progenitor cell marker CD34. An IRES-GFP (internal ribosome entry site green fluorescent protein) construct was introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 into the 3' untranslated region of one endogenous CD34 allele. Single-cell clones were generated after excision of the floxed puromycin resistance cassette by Cre recombination and correct insertion was confirmed by genotyping polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot. To validate their functionality, the reporter hiPSCs were in vitro differentiated toward CD34+ cells using the STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit combined with short-term inhibition of GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3). All cells expressing nuclear GFP were positive for cell surface CD34, thus allowing the direct monitoring of the differentiation of hiPSCs into CD34+ cells either by flow cytometry or confocal microscopy. After fluorescence-activated cell sorting, cells displaying high GFP expression exhibited increased colony-forming potential in the MethoCult colony-forming unit assays as compared with CD34+ cells obtained by magnetic-activated cell sorting. In summary, we have generated functional CD34 GFP reporter hiPSCs, which not only permit label-free separation of HSPCs, but also tracing of the emergence and fate of CD34+ progenitors at the single-cell level.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\30009677.txt,0,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold great promise for disease modeling, drug screens, and eventually cell therapy approaches.

Traditional fusion strategies such as feature concatenation often fail to learn hidden complementary and discriminative manifestations from high-dimensional multimodal data. To this end, we proposed a methodology for the integration of multimodality medical data by matching their moments in a latent space, where the hidden, shared information of multimodal data is gradually learned by optimization with multiple feature collinearity and correlation constrains. We first obtained the multimodal hidden representations by learning mappings between the original domain and shared latent space. Within this shared space, we utilized several relational regularizations, including data attribute preservation, feature collinearity and feature-task correlation, to encourage learning of the underlying associations inherent in multimodal data. The fused multimodal latent features were finally fed to a logistic regression classifier for diagnostic prediction.

29171770,Emerging biomarkers of lymphangioleiomyomatosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a destructive lung disease affecting primarily women. LAM is caused by inactivating mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes, resulting in hyperactivation of mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Over the past five years, there have been remarkable advances in the diagnosis and therapy of LAM, including the identification of vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) as a diagnostic biomarker and the US Food and Drug Administration approval of sirolimus as therapy for LAM. In appropriate clinical situations VEGF-D testing can make lung biopsy unnecessary to diagnose LAM. However, there remains an urgent unmet need for additional biomarkers of disease activity and/or response to therapy. Areas covered: This work reviews VEGF-D, an established LAM biomarker, and discusses emerging biomarkers, including circulating LAM cells, imaging, lipid, and metabolite biomarkers, focusing on those with the highest potential impact for LAM patients. Expert commentary: Ongoing research priorities include the development of validated biomarkers to 1) noninvasively diagnose LAM in women whose VEGF-D levels are not diagnostic, 2) accurately predict the likelihood of disease progression and 3) quantitatively measure disease activity and LAM cell burden.

Intensive therapy including autologous stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) has improved the poor prognosis of high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NBL) but may impair gonadal function. Objectives: To investigate the gonadal function and fertility in long-term survivors of childhood HR-NBL. Design: A cohort including all Finnish (n = 20; 11 females) long-term (>10 years) survivors of HR-NBL and an age- and sex-matched control group (n = 20) was examined at a median age of 22 (16-30) years. Oncologic treatments, pubertal timing, hormonal therapies and the number of off-spring were recorded, and pituitary and gonadal hormones were measured. Results: Altogether 16/20 of the long-term survivors of HR-NBL entered puberty spontaneously; puberty was hormonally induced in four survivors (three females). Among the 8/11 female survivors with spontaneous puberty, seven had spontaneous menarche, but 5/8 developed ovarian failure soon after puberty. Nine females currently needed estrogen substitution. AMH, a marker of ovarian reserve, was lower in the female survivors than controls (median 0.02 vs. 1.7 mug/l, p < 0.001).

METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray of 12, 432 prostate cancer specimens was performed to evaluate PSP94 expression. Correlation of PSP94 expression with tumor phenotype, patient prognosis, TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status, EZH2 expression and PTEN deletion was studied. RESULTS: PSP94 expression was increased in benign prostatic hyperplasia; however, it was downregulated in 48% and negative in 42% of the 9, 881 interpretable prostate cancer specimens. The loss of PSP94 expression was inversely correlated to EZH2 expression (P < 0.0001) and largely unrelated to the ERG status, but strongly correlated with high Gleason grade, advanced tumor stage, and nodal metastasis ( P <0.0001 each). The fraction of PSP94-negative cancer specimens increased from 40% in pT2 to 52% in pT3b-pT4 ( P < 0.0001) and from 40% in Gleason 3+3 = 6 to 46% in Gleason 4+3 = 7 and 60% in Gleason >=4+4 = 8 ( P < 0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that combined PSP94PTEN analysis can be potentially used in the clinical prognosis of prostate cancer.","['tumor', 'cancer', 'prostate cancer']",1

METHODS: One hundred and sixty-seven newly diagnosed AML patients(exclued M3 type) were enrolled in this study. The survival of patients were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method. The clinical data, laboratory findings and the survival of patients were analyzed and compared between patients with high WT1 expression (high-WT1 group) and those with low WT1 expression (low-WT1 group), as well as among the patients with NPM1 or FLT3-ITD wild type and mutants. RESULTS: The overall response rates (ORR) in high-WT1 and low-WT1 groups were 65.9% (83/126) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (P<0.01). Compared with the low-WT1 group, the high-WT1 group had lower 2-y overall survival (OS) rate (46.1% vs. 75.2%, P<0.05) and 2-y disease free survival (DFS) rate (43.5% vs. 68.5%, P<0.05). After induction chemotherapy, the patients with decreased WT1 gene expression >= 1log was associated with higher ORR and 2-y OS rate (all P<0.05), but the advantage of 2-y DFS rate was not shown (P>0.05). In patients with NPM1 wild type, the high-WT1 group had inferior ORR and 2-y OS rate (all P<0.05), while in the patients with FLT3-ITD wild type, the high-WT1 group had inferior ORR, 2-y OS rate and 2-y DFS rate (all P<0.05). In patients with NPM1 or FLT3 -ITD mutations, the WT1 expression had no significantly predicting values in treatment efficacy and survival (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: WT1 gene overexpression indicated poor prognosis of AML patients; the patients with decreased WT1 gene expression >= 1 log after the first induction therapy show better prognosis than those with<1 log.

26159157,Massive gastric polyposis associated with a germline SMAD4 gene mutation.,"Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract. Polyps are most common in the colorectum (98% of patients) and the stomach (14%). Causative mutations for JPS have been identified in two genes to date, SMAD4 and BMPR1A. SMAD4 mutations are associated with a higher incidence of gastric polyposis. In this case report, we describe two patients with massive gastric polyposis associated with a SMAD4 mutation. Both presented with anaemia and both had colonic polyps. Initial endoscopic findings revealed giant rugal folds suggestive of Menetrier disease. However, as other possible gastropathies could not be differentiated on the basis of histology, a definitive diagnosis of JPS required additional mutation analysis. In patients with polyposis predominant in or limited to the stomach, establishing a diagnosis based solely on the pathological features of polyps can be challenging due to difficulties in differentiating JPS from other hypertrophic gastropathies.

30989623,Survival and prognostic factors in surgically treated brain metastases.,"PURPOSE: While surgery and radiation remain the mainstays of therapy for all patients with brain metastases (BM), the management is moving to a more individualized approach based on the underlying tumor. We sought to identify prognostic factors of both intracranial progression (IC-PFS) and overall survival (OS) in a surgical cohort. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1015 patients treated surgically for BM at Brigham and Women's Hospital (2007-2017). Kaplan-Meier curves were used for OS and IC-PFS and Cox proportional hazards models were built to assess for predictive factors. RESULTS: Common origins were lung (43.9%), breast (14.4%), and melanoma (13.8%). Median OS for the cohort was 15.4 months (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 14.1-17.1). Breast cancer (22.1 months, 95%CI 17.8-30.3) and colorectal cancer (10.6 months, 95%CI 7.2-15.4) had the longest and shortest OS, respectively. On multivariable Cox regression, significant prognostic factors of shorter OS were age (HR 1.01, 95%CI 1.01-1.02), number of lesions (HR 1.56, 95%CI 1.28-1.89), extracranial spread at BM diagnosis (HR 1.26, 95%CI 1.05-1.52), and KPS (HR 0.98, 95%CI 0.98-0.99).

37587458,Rare disease variant curation from literature: assessing gaps with creatine transport deficiency in focus.,"Approximately 4-8% of the world suffers from a rare disease. Rare diseases are often difficult to diagnose, and many do not have approved therapies. Genetic sequencing has the potential to shorten the current diagnostic process, increase mechanistic understanding, and facilitate research on therapeutic approaches but is limited by the difficulty of novel variant pathogenicity interpretation and the communication of known causative variants. It is unknown how many published rare disease variants are currently accessible in the public domain.
This study investigated the translation of knowledge of variants reported in published manuscripts to publicly accessible variant databases. Variants, symptoms, biochemical assay results, and protein function from literature on the SLC6A8 gene associated with X-linked Creatine Transporter Deficiency (CTD) were curated and reported as a highly annotated dataset of variants with clinical context and functional details. Variants were harmonized, their availability in existing variant databases was analyzed and pathogenicity assignments were compared with impact algorithm predictions. 24% of the pathogenic variants found in PubMed articles were not captured in any database used in this analysis while only 65% of the published variants received an accurate pathogenicity prediction from at least one impact prediction algorithm.
Despite being published in the literature, pathogenicity data on patient variants may remain inaccessible for genetic diagnosis, therapeutic target identification, mechanistic understanding, or hypothesis generation. Clinical and functional details presented in the literature are important to make pathogenicity assessments. Impact predictions remain imperfect but are improving, especially for single nucleotide exonic variants, however such predictions are less accurate or unavailable for intronic and multi-nucleotide variants. Developing text mining workflows that use natural language processing for identifying diseases, genes and variants, along with impact prediction algorithms and integrating with details on clinical phenotypes and functional assessments might be a promising approach to scale literature mining of variants and assigning correct pathogenicity.

31138334,Prognostic value of B cells in cutaneous melanoma.,"BACKGROUND: Measures of the adaptive immune response have prognostic and predictive associations in melanoma and other cancer types. Specifically, intratumoral T cell density and function have considerable prognostic and predictive value in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). Less is known about the significance of tumor-infiltrating B cells in SKCM. Our goal was to understand the prognostic and predictive value of B cell phenotypic subsets in SKCM using RNA sequencing. METHODS: We used our previously published algorithm, V'DJer, to assemble B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires and estimate diversity from short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We applied machine learning-based cellular phenotype classifiers to measure relative similarity of bulk tumor sample gene expression profiles and different B cell phenotypes. We assessed these aspects of B cell biology in 473 SKCM from the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) as well as in RNA-seq data corresponding to tumor samples procured from patients who received CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors for metastatic SKCM. RESULTS: We found that the BCR repertoire was associated with different clinical factors, such as tumor tissue site and sex. However, increased clonality of the BCR repertoire was favorably prognostic in SKCM and was prognostic even after first conditioning on various clinical factors. Mutation burden was not correlated with any BCR measurement, and no specific mutation had an altered BCR repertoire. Lack of an assembled BCR in pre-treatment tumor tissues was associated with a lack of anti-tumor response to a CTLA-4 inhibitor in metastatic SKCM. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an important prognostic and predictive role for B cell characteristics in SKCM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted from January 2013 to October 2017. A total of 134 patients diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma and HER2/neu equivocal status on IHC were analyzed. Also, the cases for the years 2016 and 2017 formed a subgroup that was analyzed further to study the impact of pre-analytical factors on IHC and FISH results. RESULTS: A total of 134 women with HER2/neu IHC equivocal breast cancer were included in the study with a median age of 50 years (range 25-81). HER2/neu amplification by FISH was noted in 72 (54%) cases, whereas it was non-amplified in 52 (39%) cases. Ten cases were reported as equivocal even on FISH (ASCO/CAP 2013 guidelines). Polysomy 17 was noted in 55 cases (41%), of which 26 patients were<=50 years and 29 patients were >50 years of age. Twenty (36%) of these 55 cases showed HER2/neu amplification, whereas 26 (48%) cases were non-amplified and 9 (16%) cases were reported as equivocal on FISH. Also, more than half of the polysomy cases were hormone receptor negative. CONCLUSION: IHC is a good screening tool for negative and positive results. Any patient targeted for trastuzumab therapy should undergo confirmation of HER2/neu equivocal status by FISH analysis.

31138587,Tumor-Localized Costimulatory T-Cell Engagement by the 4-1BB/HER2 Bispecific Antibody-Anticalin Fusion PRS-343.,"PURPOSE: 4-1BB (CD137) is a key costimulatory immunoreceptor and promising therapeutic target in cancer. To overcome limitations of current 4-1BB-targeting antibodies, we have developed PRS-343, a 4-1BB/HER2 bispecific molecule. PRS-343 is designed to facilitate T-cell costimulation by tumor-localized, HER2-dependent 4-1BB clustering and activation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PRS-343 was generated by the genetic fusion of 4-1BB-specific Anticalin proteins to a variant of trastuzumab with an engineered IgG4 isotype. Its activity was characterized using a panel of in vitro assays and humanized mouse models. The safety was assessed using ex vivo human cell assays and a toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. RESULTS: PRS-343 targets 4-1BB and HER2 with high affinity and binds both targets simultaneously. 4-1BB-expressing T cells are efficiently costimulated when incubated with PRS-343 in the presence of cancer cells expressing HER2, as evidenced by increased production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL2, GM-CSF, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma). In a humanized mouse model engrafted with HER2-positive SK-OV-3 tumor cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PRS-343 leads to tumor growth inhibition and a dose-dependent increase of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In IND-enabling studies, PRS-343 was found to be well tolerated, with no overt toxicity and no relevant drug-related toxicologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: PRS-343 facilitates tumor-localized targeting of T cells by bispecific engagement of HER2 and 4-1BB. This approach has the potential to provide a more localized activation of the immune system with higher efficacy and reduced peripheral toxicity compared with current monospecific approaches.

30970592,Different Clinical Presentations and Management in Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS).,"Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder resulting from maternally inherited or de novo mutations involving the androgen receptor gene, situated in the Xq11-q12 region. The diagnosis is based on the presence of female external genitalia in a 46, XY human individual, with normally developed but undescended testes and complete unresponsiveness of target tissues to androgens. Subsequently, pelvic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be helpful in confirming the absence of Mullerian structures, revealing the presence of a blind-ending vagina and identifying testes. CAIS management still represents a unique challenge throughout childhood and adolescence, particularly regarding timing of gonadectomy, type of hormonal therapy, and psychological concerns. Indeed this condition is associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT), although TGCT results less frequently than in other disorders of sex development (DSD). Furthermore, the majority of detected tumoral lesions are non-invasive and with a low probability of progression into aggressive forms. Therefore, histological, epidemiological, and prognostic features of testicular cancer in CAIS allow postponing of the gonadectomy until after pubertal age in order to guarantee the initial spontaneous pubertal development and avoid the necessity of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) induction. However, HRT is necessary after gonadectomy in order to prevent symptoms of hypoestrogenism and to maintain secondary sexual features.

Furthermore, the majority of detected tumoral lesions are non-invasive and with a low probability of progression into aggressive forms. Therefore, histological, epidemiological, and prognostic features of testicular cancer in CAIS allow postponing of the gonadectomy until after pubertal age in order to guarantee the initial spontaneous pubertal development and avoid the necessity of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) induction. However, HRT is necessary after gonadectomy in order to prevent symptoms of hypoestrogenism and to maintain secondary sexual features. This article presents differential clinical presentations and management in patients with CAIS to emphasize the continued importance of standardizing the clinical and surgical approach to this disorder.",['cancer'],1
28942514,Intrauterine hyperglycemia-induced inflammatory signalling via the receptor for advanced glycation end products in the cardiac muscle of the infants of diabetic mother rats.,"PURPOSE: Gestational diabetes is associated with increased risk to the health of the mother and her offspring. In particular, the infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) exhibit elevated levels of preterm birth, macrosomia, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and cardiomyopathy. We have previously reported that IDMs showed abnormalities in cardiac Akt-related insulin signalling, and that these deficiencies in Akt-related signalling were attenuated by supplementing the maternal diet with fish-oil. Herein, we investigated whether the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) found in fish oil can be used to attenuate diabetes associated impairments in cardiomyocyte signalling. METHODS: Pregnant diabetic rats were administered streptozotocin before receiving EPA or water, and their infants were designated IDM/EPA, IDM/W. We assessed the potential molecular pathway for this effect in the primary cardiac cell from newborn rat hearts. RESULTS: Insulin resistance as determined by diminished GLUT4 translocation following insulin stimulation, the levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen species were elevated in the neonatal hearts of IDM/W compared with that seen in the offspring born from non-diabetic control animals. Similarly, the receptor of AGEs (RAGE) mRNA levels, reactive oxygen species and the amount of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) mRNA were higher in the hearts from the IDM/W when compared to that observed in the hearts of offspring born to non-diabetic animals. These deleterious effects of gestational diabetes were significantly decreased in the offspring of diabetic mothers receiving EPA supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that the EPA in fish oil may improve the impaired signalling and the excessive protein glycation in the cardiac muscles of infants exposed to intrauterine hyperglycemia.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\28942514.txt,0,"PURPOSE: Gestational diabetes is associated with increased risk to the health of the mother and her offspring.

However, few studies have investigated the pathobiology of shisha-induced cellular transformation. We studied the effects of chronic shisha exposure (8 months) in an in vitro model using immortalized, non-neoplastic oral keratinocytes (OKF6/TERT1). Quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses were performed on OKF6/TERT1 cells treated with shisha extract for a period of 8 months. Pathway analysis was carried out to identify significantly enriched biological processes in shisha-treated cells. Chronic shisha exposure resulted in increased cell scattering phenomenon in OKF6/TERT1 cells. Data analysis revealed differential phosphorylation of 164 peptides (fold change >=1.5, p <= 0.0.5) corresponding to 136 proteins. Proteins associated with mTORC1 and EIF4F complexes involved in initiating protein translation were seen to be enriched upon shisha treatment. Network analysis also highlighted downregulation of proteins involved in Type I interferon signaling in shisha-treated cells.

31412428,Molecular biomarkers predicting early development of endometrial carcinoma: A pilot study.,"OBJECTIVE: Endometrial carcinoma represents the most common gynaecological cancer and the sixth most frequent cancer among women worldwide. The 5-year survival of patients with stage I endometrial carcinoma is 75%-88% versus 50% for stage III or 15% for stage IV disease. Therefore, early detection could improve survival rates. Specifically, in the most prevalent, type 1 endometrial cancer develops from hyperplastic endometrium. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of cancer gene mutations from endometrial biopsies towards predicting synchronous or metachronous development of malignant lesions. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether endometrial biopsies could already carry mutations in cancer genes useful for predicting or anticipating subsequent cancer development. METHODS: Patients with a previous endometrial biopsy negative for cancer, followed by a subsequent biopsy positive for cancer, were included in the study. A fifty cancer genes targeted next-generation sequencing panel were used to investigate mutations in matched non-cancerous and malignant samples. RESULTS: All biopsies from cancer tissues harboured mutations in one or more of the following genes: APC, CTNNB1, FBXW7, HNF1A, KRAS, MTOR, NRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, RB1 and TP53. Additionally, 50% of the biopsies from matched non-cancerous tissues exhibited mutations in PTEN, KRAS or PIK3CA genes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that detecting pathogenic mutations in oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes in an otherwise benign condition is associated with a risk of developing a malignant disease.

26760961,Hepatitis B virus X protein binding to hepsin promotes C3 production by inducing IL-6 secretion from hepatocytes.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) is an important effector for HBV-associated pathogenesis. In this study, we identified hepsin as an HBx-interacting protein and investigated the effects of hepsin on HBx-mediated complement component 3 (C3) secretion in hepatocytes. In vivo and in vitro binding between HBx and hepsin was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. HBx synergized with hepsin to promote C3 production by potentiating interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion. Knockdown of endogenous hepsin attenuated C3 and IL-6 secretion induced by HBx in hepatic cells. In addition, levels of hepsin protein correlated positively with C3 expression in human non-tumor liver tissues. Further exploration revealed that HBx and hepsin increased C3 promoter activity by up-regulating the expression and phosphorylation of the transcription factor CAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP-beta), which binds to the IL-6/IL-1 response element in the C3 promoter.

However, the alterations mediated by loss of OPN in WAT before the obesogenic challenge have not yet been investigated. Therefore, we hypothesised that the lack of OPN might enhance the pro-adipogenic micro environment before obesity driven inflammation.

We investigated the potential association between the degree of involvement of BM hematopoiesis by the KIT D816V mutation and the distribution of different maturation-associated compartments of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ hematopoietic precursors (HPC) in ISM and identified the specific PB cell compartments that carry this mutation.

25612910,Evaluation of somatic mutations in tibial pseudarthrosis samples in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"BACKGROUND: Tibial pseudarthrosis is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and there is wide clinical variability of the tibial dysplasia in NF1, suggesting the possibility of genetic modifiers. Double inactivation of NF1 is postulated to be necessary for the development of tibial pseudarthrosis, but tissue or cell of origin of the 'second hit' mutation remains unclear. METHODS: Exome sequencing of different sections of surgically resected NF1 tibial pseudarthrosis tissue was performed and compared to germline (peripheral blood). RESULTS: A germline NF1 splice site mutation (c.61-2A>T, p.L21 M68del) was identified from DNA extracted from peripheral blood. Exome sequencing of DNA extracted from tissue removed during surgery of the tibial pseudarthrosis showed a somatic mutation of NF1 (c.3574G>T, p.E1192*) in the normal germline allele. Further analysis of different regions of the tibial pseudarthrosis sample showed enrichment of the somatic mutation in the soft tissue within the pseudarthrosis site and absence of the somatic mutation in cortical bone. In addition, a germline variant in PTPN11 (c.1658C>T, p.T553M), a gene involved in the RAS signal transduction pathway was identified, although the clinical significance is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the NF1 somatic mutation was primarily detected in the proliferative soft tissue at the pseudarthrosis site, it is likely that the second hit occurred in mesenchymal progenitors from the periosteum.

Double inactivation of NF1 is postulated to be necessary for the development of tibial pseudarthrosis, but tissue or cell of origin of the second hit mutation remains unclear. METHODS: Exome sequencing of different sections of surgically resected NF1 tibial pseudarthrosis tissue was performed and compared to germline (peripheral blood). RESULTS: A germline NF1 splice site mutation (c.61-2AT, p.L21 M68del) was identified from DNA extracted from peripheral blood. Exome sequencing of DNA extracted from tissue removed during surgery of the tibial pseudarthrosis showed a somatic mutation of NF1 (c.3574GT, p.E1192) in the normal germline allele. Further analysis of different regions of the tibial pseudarthrosis sample showed enrichment of the somatic mutation in the soft tissue within the pseudarthrosis site and absence of the somatic mutation in cortical bone. In addition, a germline variant in PTPN11 (c.1658CT, p.T553M), a gene involved in the RAS signal transduction pathway was identified, although the clinical significance is unknown.

29794022,YAP Controls Endothelial Activation and Vascular Inflammation Through TRAF6.,"RATIONALE: Microvascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction secondary to unchecked activation of endothelium play a critical role in the pathophysiology of sepsis and organ failure. The intrinsic signaling mechanisms responsible for dampening excessive activation of endothelial cells are not completely understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine the central role of YAP (Yes-associated protein), the major transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway, in modulating the strength and magnitude of endothelial activation and vascular inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endothelial-specific YAP knockout mice showed increased basal expression of E-selectin and ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecule)-1 in endothelial cells, a greater number of adherent neutrophils in postcapillary venules and increased neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Lipopolysaccharide challenge of these mice augmented NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) activation, expression of endothelial adhesion proteins, neutrophil and monocyte adhesion to cremaster muscle venules, transendothelial neutrophil migration, and lung inflammatory injury. Deletion of YAP in endothelial cells also markedly augmented the inflammatory response and cardiovascular dysfunction in a polymicrobial sepsis model induced by cecal ligation and puncture. YAP functioned by interacting with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TLR (Toll-like receptor) signaling adaptor TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6) to ubiquitinate TRAF6, and thus promoted TRAF6 degradation and modification resulting in inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. TRAF6 depletion in endothelial cells rescued the augmented inflammatory phenotype in mice with endothelial cell-specific deletion of YAP. CONCLUSIONS: YAP modulates the activation of endothelial cells and suppresses vascular inflammation through preventing TRAF6-mediated NF-kappaB activation and is hence essential for limiting the severity of sepsis-induced inflammation and organ failure.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\29794022.txt,0,"RATIONALE: Microvascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction secondary to unchecked activation of endothelium play a critical role in the pathophysiology of sepsis and organ failure.

25833810,Activation of KIT modulates the function of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R) in mast cells.,"BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is characterized by the accumulation of mast cells (MCs) associated with activating mutations of KIT. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors (TRAIL-Rs) are preferentially expressed on neoplastic cells and induce the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Recent studies reported on the expression of TRAIL-Rs and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cultured human MCs, which depend on stem cell factor (SCF)-induced or constitutive KIT activation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We sought to further define the impact of TRAIL-Rs on MCs in vivo and in vitro. Using Cre/loxP recombination, we generated mice with MC-specific and ubiquitous knockout of TRAIL-R. In these mice, anaphylaxis and numbers of MCs were investigated. We also explored the expression and function of TRAIL-Rs in cultured murine and human MCs upon activation of KIT. By conducting immunofluorescence staining, we analyzed the expression of TRAIL-Rs in MCs infiltrating the bone marrow of patients with mastocytosis. RESULTS: MC-specific deletion of TRAIL-R was associated with a slight, but significant increase in anaphylaxis. Numbers of MCs in MC-specific knockouts of TRAIL-R were comparable to controls. Whereas cultured IL-3-dependent murine MCs from wild-type mice were resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, SCF-stimulated MCs underwent apoptosis in response to TRAIL. Interestingly, activating KIT mutations also promoted sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human MCs. In line with these findings, MCs infiltrating the bone marrow of patients with mastocytosis expressed TRAIL-R1. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of KIT regulates the function of TRAIL-Rs in MCs. TRAIL-R1 may represent an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic target in diseases associated with KIT mutations, such as mastocytosis.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25833810.txt,0,"BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is characterized by the accumulation of mast cells (MCs) associated with activating mutations of KIT.

Development of chemo-resistance is ultimately responsible for treatment failure and relapse, therefore understanding the molecular basis underlying resistance is imperative for developing innovative treatment strategies. Glucocorticoids (GCs) such dexamethasone and prednisolone are the backbone of combination chemotherapy regimens for treating all lymphoid tumors. However, the biological mechanisms of primary GC resistance in ALL is not completely understood. We previously performed a longitudinal whole-exome sequencing analysis on diagnosis/relapse pairs from adult patients with ALL. Our data revealed that relapse-specific truncation mutations in the NR3C1 gene, encoding the GC receptor, are frequently detected. METHODS: In the current study, we used discovery-based strategies including RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and CRISPR/Cas9, followed by confirmatory testing, in human ALL cell lines, bone marrow blast samples from ALL patients and xenograft models, to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for resistance. RESULTS: Our results revealed a positive correlation between endogenous expression of NR3C1 in ALL cells and sensitivity to GCs and clinical outcomes. We further confirmed that ectopic expression of NR3C1 in ALL cells could reverse GC resistance, while deletion of NR3C1 confers resistance to GCs in ALL cell lines and xenograft models. RNA-seq analysis revealed a remarkable abundance of gene signatures involved in pathways in cancer, DNA replication, mismatch repair, P53 signalling, cell cycle, and apoptosis regulated by NR3C1. Significantly increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes including BCL2L11/Bim, BMF, BAD, BAX and BOK, and decreased transcription of anti-apoptotic genes including BCL2, BCL2L1 and BAG2 were observed in GC-resistant ALL cells following ectopic expression of NR3C1. Finally, we explored that GC resistance in ALL cells with haploinsufficiency of NR3C1 can be treated with Bcl-2 blockage. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the status of NR3C1 gene mutations and basal expression levels of NR3C1 in ALL cells are associated with sensitivity to GCs and clinical treatment outcomes.

Insights into the molecular basis of ACC can pave the way for the application of more effective, personalized therapies and detection of patients with hereditary predisposition. Molecular analysis revealed a germline BRCA2 (and CHEK2) mutation in a patient with a rare pancreatic ACC with extensive intraductal growth. Somatic loss of the wild-type BRCA2 allele in the tumor indicated the causal relationship of ACC with the germline defect. A thorough literature review identified another nine ACCs associated with germline BRCA2 mutation and two ACCs associated with germline BRCA1 mutation, resulting in a prevalence of BRCA1/2 germline mutations in almost 7% of ACCs. Moreover, somatic BRCA1/2 alterations are reported in 16% of sporadic ACCs. Overall, about one fifth (22%) of all pancreatic ACCs exhibit BRCA1/2 deficiency.

Full recovery is possible if therapy is initiated early in the disease course. Detection of ANRE antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is essential for diagnosis. The assays for ANRE-associated IgGs often rely on cells transiently transfected with NMDAR genes. A cell line that stably expresses pathogenic NMDAR epitopes could improve standardization of the assays and provide antigen that could be used in commercial solid state assay systems. RESULTS: We expressed the amino terminal domain (ATD) of the GluN1 NMDAR subunit (NR1) as a fusion protein on the outer plasma membrane of 293T cells, creating a stable cell population (293T-ATD) that is recognized by ANRE patient monoclonal antibodies in flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assays. The ATD fusion protein also contains a Myc tag and a 6XHIS tag, which provide functionality for immunoassays and antigen purification, and a TEV protease site, which allows the ATD domain to be specifically released from the cells in essentially pure form. ATD mobilized from the 293T ATD cell line maintained the pathogenic ANRE epitopes in ELISA binding assays.

37901227,Significance of HLA-E and its two NKG2 receptors in development of complications after allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells.,"Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT) is a procedure commonly used in treatment of various haematological disorders which is associated with significantly improved survival rates. However, one of its drawbacks is the possibility of development of post-transplant complications, including acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or CMV infection. Various studies suggested that NK cells and their receptors may affect the transplant outcome. In the present study, patients and donors were found to significantly differ in the distribution of the <i>NKG2A</i> rs7301582 genetic variants - recipients carried the <i>C</i> allele more often than their donors (0.975 vs 0.865, p<0.0001). Increased soluble HLA-E (sHLA-E) levels detected in recipients' serum 30 days after transplantation seemed to play a prognostic and protective role. It was observed that recipients with higher sHLA-E levels were less prone to chronic GvHD (11.65 vs 6.33 pg/mL, p=0.033) or more severe acute GvHD grades II-IV (11.07 vs 8.04 pg/mL, p=0.081). Our results also showed an unfavourable role of HLA-E donor-recipient genetic incompatibility in CMV infection development after transplantation (OR=5.92, p=0.014).

25324352,Prospective blinded study of BRAFV600E mutation detection in cell-free DNA of patients with systemic histiocytic disorders.,"UNLABELLED: Patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) have a high frequency of BRAF(V600E) mutations and respond to RAF inhibitors. However, detection of mutations in tissue biopsies is particularly challenging in histiocytoses due to low tumor content and stromal contamination. We applied a droplet-digital PCR assay for quantitative detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in plasma and urine cell-free (cf) DNA and performed a prospective, blinded study in 30 patients with ECD/LCH. There was 100% concordance between tissue and urinary cfDNA genotype in treatment-naive samples. cfDNA analysis facilitated identification of previously undescribed KRAS(G12S)-mutant ECD and dynamically tracked disease burden in patients treated with a variety of therapies. These results indicate that cfDNA BRAF(V600E) mutational analysis in plasma and urine provides a convenient and reliable method of detecting mutational status and can serve as a noninvasive biomarker to monitor response to therapy in LCH and ECD. SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant histiocytic disorders have remarkable responses to RAF inhibition, but mutation detection in tissue in these disorders is challenging.

25759145,ATM gene single nucleotide polymorphisms predict regimen-related gastrointestinal toxicity in patients allografted after reduced conditioning.,"Polymorphisms of genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity have become an object of major interest in regard to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complications. Regimen-related gastrointestinal toxicity (RR-GIT) is the dominant complication during the pre-engraftment period and has been linked to increased risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) development. According to our hypothesis, functional variants of genes participating in DNA damage response (DDR) may have an impact on the extent of tissue damage caused by the conditioning regimen. In our single-center study, we analyzed 62 patients who underwent HSCT from HLA-identical donors after reduced conditioning. The patients were genotyped for 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs4585 T/G, rs189037 A/G, rs227092 T/G, rs228590 C/T, and rs664677 T/C) of the ATM gene-the essential member of the DDR pathways, using allele-specific matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry assay. Because of almost absolute linkage disequilibrium observed among all 5 SNPs, association of 2 major ATM haplotypes (ATM1/ATM2) with RR-GIT and acute GVHD (aGVHD) was analyzed. Importantly, the univariate and multivariate analysis showed that patients homozygous for ATM2 haplotype (rs4585*T, rs189037*A, rs227092*T, rs228590*C, and rs664677*T) are more likely to suffer from high-grade RR-GIT than ATM1 homozygous patients.

27011217,The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe: an update.,"The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe is a rare X-linked multisystemic disorder characterized by the triad of congenital cataracts, intellectual disability, and proximal renal tubular dysfunction. Whereas the ocular manifestations and severe muscular hypotonia are the typical first diagnostic clues apparent at birth, the manifestations of incomplete renal Fanconi syndrome are often recognized only later in life. Other characteristic features are progressive severe growth retardation and behavioral problems, with tantrums. Many patients develop a debilitating arthropathy. Treatment is symptomatic, and the life span rarely exceeds 40 years. The causative oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe gene (OCRL) encodes the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase OCRL-1. OCRL variants have not only been found in classic Lowe syndrome, but also in patients with a predominantly renal phenotype classified as Dent disease type 2 (Dent-2). Recent data indicate that there is a phenotypic continuum between Dent-2 disease and Lowe syndrome, suggesting that there are individual differences in the ability to compensate for the loss of enzyme function. Extensive research has demonstrated that OCRL-1 is involved in multiple intracellular processes involving endocytic trafficking and actin skeleton dynamics. This explains the multi-organ manifestations of the disease. Still, the mechanisms underlying the wide phenotypic spectrum are poorly understood, and we are far from a causative therapy.

The functions of 53BP1 in NHEJ processes are not well understood. Here, we report that 53BP1 promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and genomic stability not only in c-NHEJ-proficient but also -deficient human G1-phase cells. Using an array of repair substrates we show that these effects of 53BP1 are correlated with a promotion of microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), a subtype of alt-NHEJ, in G1-phase. Consistent with a specific role in MMEJ we confirm that 53BP1 status does not affect c-NHEJ. 53BP1 supports sequence deletion during MMEJ consistent with a putative role in facilitating end-resection. Interestingly, promotion of MMEJ by 53BP1 in G1-phase cells is only observed in the presence of functional BRCA1. Depletion of both 53BP1 and BRCA1 increases repair needing microhomology usage and augments loss of DNA sequence, suggesting that MMEJ is a highly regulated DSB repair process.

31672142,Probable progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome with immunosuppressant dose reduction following lung transplantation: a case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rapidly developing demyelinating disease in the cerebral white matter and is often caused by JC polyomavirus (JCV). PML after lung transplantation is rare and has a poor prognosis, with no established therapies. Reducing the patient's immunosuppressant doses, thereby restoring immunity, could be used to treat PML. However, some patients develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with this treatment, an immune-induced inflammatory response to JCV that results in serious neuronal damage. We herein report a case of a 60-year-old female who suffered from PML 5 years after lung transplantation, had worsened brain lesions thought to be related to PML-IRIS at the time of immunosuppressant reduction, and missed treatment opportunities. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female developed PML 5 years after lung transplantation. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple high-signal lesions, mainly in the cerebral white matter. Polymerase chain reaction found 0.32 million copies/mL of JCV in the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, she was given a diagnosis of PML. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus dosages were reduced, and CD4-positive cell counts and the blood concentration of each immunosuppressant were monitored. Mefloquine was also orally administered at a daily dose of 275 mg for 3 days and was then administered at a dose of 275 mg per week. Although the patient's CD4-positive cell counts increased and her immune system recovered, her symptoms and brain MRI findings worsened. We suspected PML progression or a transition to PML-IRIS. Steroid pulse therapy to suppress the inflammatory lesions was not possible but was retrospectively indicated. The patient rapidly began to exhibit akinetic mutism and died 4 months after the onset of neurologic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: When neurologic symptoms and abnormal brain MRI findings are noted during immune recovery, it is often difficult to distinguish between progressed PML and PML-IRIS. However, the pathogenesis of brain lesions usually involves inflammation and immune-reactive mechanisms for JCV.

METHODS: A total of 5 000 pieces of prostate cancer magnetic resonance (MR) imaging discovery sets with manual annotations were used to train a modified U-net, and a set of clinically demand-oriented, stable and efficient full convolutional neural network algorithm was constructed. The MR images were cropped and segmented automatically by using modified U-net, and the segmentation data were automatically reconstructed using MITK platform according to our own protocols. The modeling data were output as STL format, and the prostate models were simultaneously displayed on an android tablet during the operation to help achieving cognitive navigation. RESULTS: Based on original U-net architecture, we established a modified U-net from a 201-case MR imaging training set. The network performance was tested and compared with human segmentations and other segmentation networks by using one certain testing data set. Auto segmentation of multi-structures (such as prostate, prostate tumors, seminal vesicles, rectus, neurovascular bundles and dorsal venous complex) were successfully achieved.

38041113,Development of a neutralization monoclonal antibody with a broad neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV-2 variants.,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants has challenged the effectiveness of current therapeutic regimens. Here, we aimed to develop a potent SARS-CoV-2 antibody with broad neutralizing effect by screening a scFv library with the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) via phage display.
SKAI-DS84 was identified through phage display, and we performed pseudovirus neutralization assays, authentic virus neutralization assays, and in vivo neutralization efficacy evaluations. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was conducted to assess the physical characteristics of the antibody, including binding kinetics and measure its affinity for variant RBDs.
The selected clones were converted to human IgG, and among them, SKAI-DS84 was selected for further analyses based on its binding affinity with the variant RBDs.

31103372,Reactivity with the EpCAM-specific antibodies MOC-31 and Ber-Ep4 in plasma cell neoplasms: a potential diagnostic pitfall in cytology samples.,"OBJECTIVE: Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a protein expressed on surfaces of healthy epithelia, and is overexpressed in dysplasias and carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) utilizing antibodies that react with EpCAM, such as MOC-31 and Ber-EP4, distinguish reactive mesothelial cells from carcinomas in serous effusions. IHC is crucial in effusions with singly dispersed atypical cells, a scenario with a broad differential, including hematopoietic malignancies. Plasma cell neoplasms (PCN) are the second most common hematopoietic malignancy, manifesting as multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma, with 6% of cases developing serous cavity involvement. Most PCNs are readily recognizable; however, variants that deviate from the classic cytomorphology risk erroneous diagnosis. This study demonstrates EpCAM expression in a subset of PCNs, highlighting a potential diagnostic pitfall in serous effusion cytology. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective search for cytology specimens with a diagnosis of PCN was performed. All cases demonstrating CD138/CD38 and monoclonal immunoglobulin expression, and adequately cellular cell block were included.

38640937,"Mechanisms and management of loss of response to anti-TNF therapy for patients with Crohn's disease: 3-year data from the prospective, multicentre PANTS cohort study.","We sought to report the effectiveness of infliximab and adalimumab over the first 3 years of treatment and to define the factors that predict anti-TNF treatment failure and the strategies that prevent or mitigate loss of response.
Personalised Anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's disease (PANTS) is a UK-wide, multicentre, prospective observational cohort study reporting the rates of effectiveness of infliximab and adalimumab in anti-TNF-naive patients with active luminal Crohn's disease aged 6 years and older. At the end of the first year, sites were invited to enrol participants still receiving study drug into the 2-year PANTS-extension study. We estimated rates of remission across the whole cohort at the end of years 1, 2, and 3 of the study using a modified survival technique with permutation testing. Multivariable regression and survival analyses were used to identify factors associated with loss of response in patients who had initially responded to anti-TNF therapy and with immunogenicity. Loss of response was defined in patients who initially responded to anti-TNF therapy at the end of induction and who subsequently developed symptomatic activity that warranted an escalation of steroid, immunomodulatory, or anti-TNF therapy, resectional surgery, or exit from study due to treatment failure. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03088449, and is now complete.
Between March 19, 2014, and Sept 21, 2017, 389 (41%) of 955 patients treated with infliximab and 209 (32%) of 655 treated with adalimumab in the PANTS study entered the PANTS-extension study (median age 32·5 years [IQR 22·1-46·8], 307 [51%] of 598 were female, and 291 [49%] were male). The estimated proportion of patients in remission at the end of years 1, 2, and 3 were, for infliximab 40·2% (95% CI 36·7-43·7), 34·4% (29·9-39·0), and 34·7% (29·8-39·5), and for adalimumab 35·9% (95% CI 31·2-40·5), 32·9% (26·8-39·2), and 28·9% (21·9-36·3), respectively. Optimal drug concentrations at week 14 to predict remission at any later timepoints were 6·1-10·0 mg/L for infliximab and 10·1-12·0 mg/L for adalimumab. After excluding patients who had primary non-response, the estimated proportions of patients who had loss of response by years 1, 2, and 3 were, for infliximab 34·4% (95% CI 30·4-38·2), 54·5% (49·4-59·0), and 60·0% (54·1-65·2), and for adalimumab 32·1% (26·7-37·1), 47·2% (40·2-53·4), and 68·4% (50·9-79·7), respectively. In multivariable analysis, loss of response at year 2 and 3 for patients treated with infliximab and adalimumab was predicted by low anti-TNF drug concentrations at week 14 (infliximab: hazard ratio [HR] for each ten-fold increase in drug concentration 0·45 [95% CI 0·30-0·67], adalimumab: 0·39 [0·22-0·70]). For patients treated with infliximab, loss of response was also associated with female sex (vs male sex; HR 1·47 [95% CI 1·11-1·95]), obesity (vs not obese 1·62 [1·08-2·42]), baseline white cell count (1·06 [1·02-1·11) per 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> increase in cells per L), and thiopurine dose quartile. Among patients treated with adalimumab, carriage of the HLA-DQA1*05 risk variant was associated with loss of response (HR 1·95 [95% CI 1·17-3·25]). By the end of year 3, the estimated proportion of patients who developed anti-drug antibodies associated with undetectable drug concentrations was 44·0% (95% CI 38·1-49·4) among patients treated with infliximab and 20·3% (13·8-26·2) among those treated with adalimumab. The development of anti-drug antibodies associated with undetectable drug concentrations was significantly associated with treatment without concomitant immunomodulator use for both groups (HR for immunomodulator use: infliximab 0·40 [95% CI 0·31-0·52], adalimumab 0·42 [95% CI 0·24-0·75]), and with carriage of HLA-DQA1*05 risk variant for infliximab (HR for carriage of risk variant: infliximab 1·46 [1·13-1·88]) but not for adalimumab (HR 1·60 [0·92-2·77]). Concomitant use of an immunomodulator before or on the day of starting infliximab was associated with increased time without the development of anti-drug antibodies associated with undetectable drug concentrations compared with use of infliximab alone (HR 2·87 [95% CI 2·20-3·74]) or introduction of an immunomodulator after anti-TNF initiation (1·70 [1·11-2·59]). In years 2 and 3, 16 (4%) of 389 patients treated with infliximab and 11 (5%) of 209 treated with adalimumab had adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal. Nine (2%) patients treated with infliximab and two (1%) of those treated with adalimumab had serious infections in years 2 and 3.
Only around a third of patients with active luminal Crohn's disease treated with an anti-TNF drug were in remission at the end of 3 years of treatment. Low drug concentrations at the end of the induction period predict loss of response by year 3 of treatment, suggesting higher drug concentrations during the first year of treatment, particularly during induction, might lead to better long-term outcomes. Anti-drug antibodies associated with undetectable drug concentrations of infliximab, but not adalimumab, can be predicted by carriage of HLA-DQA1*05 and mitigated by concomitant immunomodulator use for both drugs.

A facile virus fusion mechanism compensates for the sparse Env copy number observed on viral particles and includes a 22-amino-acid, lentivirus-specific adaptation at the gp41 base (amino acid residues 662-683), termed the membrane proximal external region (MPER). We show by NMR and EPR that the MPER consists of a structurally conserved pair of viral lipid-immersed helices separated by a hinge with tandem joints that can be locked by capping residues between helices.

Here we explain how the limitations of existing drugs and nonspecific immune-based therapies are circumvented with techniques in modern immunotherapy. The successes outlined represent the most promising path to finally targeting the prototypical undruggable RAS oncogene family.","['oncology', 'cancer']",1
30179860,Loss of placental growth factor ameliorates maternal hypertension and preeclampsia in mice.,"Preeclampsia remains a clinical challenge due to its poorly understood pathogenesis. A prevailing notion is that increased placental production of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) causes the maternal syndrome by inhibiting proangiogenic placental growth factor (PlGF) and VEGF. However, the significance of PlGF suppression in preeclampsia is uncertain. To test whether preeclampsia results from the imbalance of angiogenic factors reflected by an abnormal sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, we studied PlGF KO (Pgf-/-) mice and noted that the mice did not develop signs or sequelae of preeclampsia despite a marked elevation in circulating sFLT-1. Notably, PlGF KO mice had morphologically distinct placentas, showing an accumulation of junctional zone glycogen. We next considered the role of placental PlGF in an established model of preeclampsia (pregnant catechol-O-methyltransferase-deficient [COMT-deficient] mice) by generating mice with deletions in both the Pgf and Comt genes. Deletion of placental PlGF in the context of COMT loss resulted in a reduction in maternal blood pressure and increased placental glycogen, indicating that loss of PlGF might be protective against the development of preeclampsia. These results identify a role for PlGF in placental development and support a complex model for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia beyond an angiogenic factor imbalance.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\30179860.txt,0,"Preeclampsia remains a clinical challenge due to its poorly understood pathogenesis.

We aimed to assess whether romiplostim is safe and effective in children with immune thrombocytopenia of more than 6 months' duration. METHODS: In this phase 3 double-blind study, eligible participants were children with immune thrombocytopenia aged 1 year to 17 years and mean platelet counts 30 x 10(9)/L or less (mean of two measurements during the screening period) with no single count greater than 35 x 10(9)/L, and were recruited from 27 sites in the USA, Canada, and Australia. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) through the interactive voice response system to receive weekly romiplostim or placebo for 24 weeks stratified by age (1 year to <6 years, 6 years to <12 years, 12 years to <18 years), adjusting the dose weekly from 1 mug/kg to 10 mug/kg to target platelet counts of 50-200 x 10(9)/L. Patients and investigators were blinded to the treatment assignment. The primary analysis included all randomised patients and the safety analysis included all randomised patients who received at least one dose of investigational product. The primary endpoint, durable platelet response, was defined as achievement of weekly platelet responses (platelet counts >=50 x 10(9)/L without rescue drug use in the preceding 4 weeks) in 6 or more of the final 8 weeks (weeks 18-25). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 01444417. FINDINGS: Between Jan 24, 2012, and Sept 3, 2014, 62 patients were randomly assigned; 42 to romiplostim and 20 to placebo. Durable platelet response was seen in 22 (52%) patients in the romiplostim group and two (10%) in the placebo group (p=0 002, odds ratio 9 1 [95% CI 1 9-43 2]). Durable platelet response rates with romiplostim by age were 38% (3/8) for 1 year to younger than 6 years, 56% (10/18) for 6 years to younger than 12 years, and 56% (9/16) for 12 years to younger than 18 years. One (5%) of 19 patients in the placebo group had serious adverse events compared with 10 (24%) of 42 patients in the romiplostim group.

30929114,Review of ependymomas: assessment of consensus in pathological diagnosis and correlations with genetic profiles and outcome.,"We focused on histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of ependymoma (EPN) with molecular profiles to develop more reproducible criteria of the diagnosis. Three expert neuropathologists reviewed the pathology of 130 samples from the Japan Pediatric Molecular Neuro-Oncology Group study. Confirmed cases were assessed for histology, surrogate markers, molecular subgrouping, and survival data. We reached a consensus regarding the diagnosis of EPNs in 100% of spinal cord tumors and 93% of posterior fossa (PF) tumors that had been diagnosed as EPNs by local pathologists, whereas we reached a consensus regarding only 77% of the local diagnosis of supratentorial (ST) EPNs. Among the PF-EPNs, most of anaplastic ependymomas (AEPNs) were defined as EPN-A by methylation profiling, which was significantly correlated with the subgroup assignment. Regarding prognosis, the overall survival of patients with PF-EPN was significantly better than that of patients with PF AEPN (p = 0.01). Histologically, all ependymoma, RELA fusion-positive (EPN-RELA) qualified as Grade III. Both L1 cell adhesion molecule and nuclear factor kappaB p65 antibodies showed good sensitivity for detecting EPN-RELA.

Here, we investigated the potential involvement of BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from ISM patients by the KIT D816V mutation and its potential impact on disease progression and outcome. This mutation was investigated in highly purified BM MSCs and other BM cell populations from 83 ISM patients followed for a median of 116 months. KIT D816V-mutated MSCs were detected in 22 of 83 cases. All MSC-mutated patients had multilineage KIT mutation (100% vs 30%, P = .0001) and they more frequently showed involvement of lymphoid plus myeloid BM cells (59% vs 22%; P = .03) and a polyclonal pattern of inactivation of the X-chromosome of KIT-mutated BM mast cells (64% vs 0%; P = .01) vs other multilineage ISM cases. Moreover, presence of KIT-mutated MSCs was associated with more advanced disease features, a greater rate of disease progression (50% vs 17%; P = .04), and a shorter progression-free survival (P <= .003). Overall, these results support the notion that ISM patients with mutated MSCs may have acquired the KIT mutation in a common pluripotent progenitor cell, prior to differentiation into MSCs and hematopoietic precursor cells, before the X-chromosome inactivation process occurs.

Herein, we present a case of early-stage SMPNSCLC with T790M and L858R mutations. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old male patient presented to the Thoracic Surgery Department due to a tumor in the right lower lung. The tumor was detected more than 5 years previously during a health examination; however, the patient ignored the problem because the clinician at that time stated that the lesion was highly likely to be benign. Chest computed topography (CT) was ordered and the images showed a well-defined tumor in the right lower lung and a faint nodular lesion over the left lower lung field. A CT-guided biopsy results showed the presence of atypical cells and positive staining of TTF-1 and CK7. Surgical intervention was performed. The right- and left-sided tumors disclosed micropapillary predominant adenocarcinoma and acinar-predominant adenocarcinoma, respectively. Both tumors were positive for TTF-1 but negative for ALK and p40. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the right-sided tumor had an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation presenting as point mutation T790M in exon 20, while the left-sided tumor had a point mutation L858R in exon 21 of EGFR. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient's case suggests that tumors resembling a benign pattern with central calcification may be misdiagnosed. Thus, early screening for lung cancer is important, and intensive efforts to make a diagnosis through surgical resection or biopsies to allow for tailored optimal treatment may be preferential for the best patient outcomes.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31426797.txt,1,"BACKGROUND: Concurrent mutations of synchronous multiple primary non-small cell lung cancer (SMPNSCLC) is rare, and only a few cases have been reported.

According to updated ALK testing guidelines from the College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the Association for Molecular Pathology published in 2018, ALK immunohistochemistry is formally an alternative to ALK FISH, and simultaneous detection of multiple hot spots, including, at least, ALK, ROS1, RET, MET, ERBB2, BRAF and KRAS genes is also recommended while performing next generation sequencing (NGS)-based testing. Therefore, ALK status in a specimen can be tested by different methods and platforms, even in the same institution or laboratory. In this review, we discuss several clinically relevant technical aspects of ALK FISH, including pros and cons of the unique two-step (50- to 100-cell) analysis approach employed in the Vysis Break Apart ALK FISH assay, including: the preset cutoff value of >=15% for a positive result; technical aspects and biology of discordant results obtained by different methods; and incidental findings, such as ALK copy number gain or amplification and co-existent driver mutations. These issues have practical implications for ALK testing in the clinical laboratory following the updated guidelines.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31412611.txt,1,"In 2011, the Vysis Break Apart ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a companion diagnostic for detecting ALK rearrangement in lung cancer patients who may benefit from treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

31407494,"Risk stratification for lung adenocarcinoma on EGFR and TP53 mutation status, chemotherapy, and PD-L1 immunotherapy.","The overall survival rates for lung cancer remain unsatisfactorily low, even for patients with biomarkers for which target therapies or immunotherapies are recommended. Better identification of at-risk patients is needed to achieve more effective personalized treatment. Here, we derived a risk-stratifying gene signature consisting of five genes that had the greatest differential expression by stage from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) transcriptomes. The new gene signature enabled survival prognosis for multiple LUAD datasets from different platforms of transcriptomics and risk stratification for patients with and without a mutation in TP53 or EGFR, with high and low levels of PD-L1, and with and without adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Using these evaluations, it was also shown to be more robust compared to several other gene signatures. Functional analysis of the five genes and their protein-protein interaction partners indicated that they are functionally enriched in cell cycle, endocytosis, and EGFR regulation, which are biological processes associated with lung cancer and drug resistance. Extensive discussions on related experimental studies suggest that the five genes are novel and sensible targets for developing new drugs and/or tackling drug resistance problems for LUAD.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31407494.txt,1,"The overall survival rates for lung cancer remain unsatisfactorily low, even for patients with biomarkers for which target therapies or immunotherapies are recommended.

26020630,Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoT Induces Atypical Anoikis Apoptosis in Target Host Cells by Transforming Crk Adaptor Protein into a Cytotoxin.,"Previously, we demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoT induces potent apoptosis in host epithelial cells in a manner that primarily depends on its ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (ADPRT) activity. However, the mechanism underlying ExoT/ADPRT-induced apoptosis remains undetermined. We now report that ExoT/ADPRT disrupts focal adhesion sites, activates p38beta and JNK, and interferes with integrin-mediated survival signaling; causing atypical anoikis. We show that ExoT/ADPRT-induced anoikis is mediated by the Crk adaptor protein. We found that Crk-/- knockout cells are significantly more resistant to ExoT-induced apoptosis, while Crk-/- cells complemented with Crk are rendered sensitive to ExoT-induced apoptosis. Moreover, a dominant negative (DN) mutant form of Crk phenocopies ExoT-induced apoptosis both kinetically and mechanistically. Crk is generally believed to be a component of focal adhesion (FA) and its role in cellular survival remains controversial in that it has been found to be either pro-survival or pro-apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that although Crk is recruited to FA sites, its function is likely not required for FA assembly or for survival per se. However, when modified by ExoT or by mutagenesis, it can be transformed into a cytotoxin that induces anoikis by disrupting FA sites and interfering with integrin survival signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first example whereby a bacterial toxin exerts its cytotoxicity by subverting the function of an innocuous host cellular protein and turning it against the host cell.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\26020630.txt,0,"Previously, we demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoT induces potent apoptosis in host epithelial cells in a manner that primarily depends on its ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (ADPRT) activity.

24789688,Fifty-four novel mutations in the NF1 gene and integrated analyses of the mutations that modulate splicing.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. One of the hallmarks of NF1 is the high mutation rate in this gene. In this study, we present 127 different NF1 mutations and 54 novel mutations detected at both the genomic DNA and mRNA level using a retrospective case series review. We found that 25.2% of these different mutations induced aberrant splicing. Of note, 40.6% of these splicing errors were caused by exonic variants. In addition, one mutation produced mosaicism in the post-transcriptional profile. However, studies investigating these splicing aberrations are limited.

25476696,Intestinal epithelial MyD88 is a sensor switching host metabolism towards obesity according to nutritional status.,"Obesity is associated with a cluster of metabolic disorders, low-grade inflammation and altered gut microbiota. Whether host metabolism is controlled by intestinal innate immune system and the gut microbiota is unknown. Here we report that inducible intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of MyD88 partially protects against diet-induced obesity, diabetes and inflammation. This is associated with increased energy expenditure, an improved glucose homeostasis, reduced hepatic steatosis, fat mass and inflammation. Protection is transferred following gut microbiota transplantation to germ-free recipients. We also demonstrate that intestinal epithelial MyD88 deletion increases anti-inflammatory endocannabinoids, restores antimicrobial peptides production and increases intestinal regulatory T cells during diet-induced obesity. Targeting MyD88 after the onset of obesity reduces fat mass and inflammation. Our work thus identifies intestinal epithelial MyD88 as a sensor changing host metabolism according to the nutritional status and we show that targeting intestinal epithelial MyD88 constitutes a putative therapeutic target for obesity and related disorders.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25476696.txt,0,"Obesity is associated with a cluster of metabolic disorders, low-grade inflammation and altered gut microbiota.

27323230,The cilium: a cellular antenna with an influence on obesity risk.,"Primary cilia are organelles that are present on many different cell types, either transiently or permanently. They play a crucial role in receiving signals from the environment and passing these signals to other parts of the cell. In that way, they are involved in diverse processes such as adipocyte differentiation and olfactory sensation. Mutations in genes coding for ciliary proteins often have pleiotropic effects and lead to clinical conditions, ciliopathies, with multiple symptoms. In this study, we reviewed observations from ciliopathies with obesity as one of the symptoms. It shows that variation in cilia-related genes is itself not a major cause of obesity in the population but may be a part of the multifactorial aetiology of this complex condition. Both common polymorphisms and rare deleterious variants may contribute to the obesity risk. Genotype-phenotype relationships have been noticed. Among the ciliary genes, obesity differs with regard to severity and age of onset, which may relate to the influence of each gene on the balance between pro- and anti-adipogenic processes. Analysis of the function and location of the proteins encoded by these ciliary genes suggests that obesity is more linked to activities at the basal area of the cilium, including initiation of the intraflagellar transport, but less to the intraflagellar transport itself.

25040471,Ataxia telangiectasia: more variation at clinical and cellular levels.,"Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare recessively inherited disorder resulting in a progressive neurological decline. It is caused by biallelic mutation of the ATM gene that encodes a 370 kDa serine/threonine protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating many target proteins. ATM is activated by auto(trans)phosphorylation in response to DNA double strand breaks and leads to the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and either DNA repair or apoptosis as part of the cellular response to DNA damage. The allelic heterogeneity in A-T is striking. While the majority of mutations are truncating, leading to instability and loss of the ATM protein from the allele, a significant proportion of patients carry one of a small number of mutations that are either missense or leaky splice site mutations resulting in retention of some ATM with activity. The allelic heterogeneity in ATM, therefore, results in an equally striking clinical heterogeneity. There is also locus heterogeneity because mutation of the MRE11 gene can cause an obvious A-T like disorder both clinically and also at the cellular level and mutation of the RNF168 gene results in a much milder clinical phenotype, neurologically, with the major clinical feature being an immunological defect.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25040471.txt,0,"Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare recessively inherited disorder resulting in a progressive neurological decline.

Yet, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir failed as post-exposure prophylaxis in a trial, and frequent viral rebound has been observed in subsequent cohorts. We developed a mathematical model capturing viral-immune dynamics and nirmatrelvir pharmacokinetics that recapitulated viral loads from this and another clinical trial (PLATCOV). Our results suggest that nirmatrelvir's <i>in vivo</i> potency is significantly lower than <i>in vitro</i> assays predict. According to our model, a maximally potent agent would reduce the viral load by approximately 3.5 logs relative to placebo at 5 days. The model identifies that earlier initiation and shorter treatment duration are key predictors of post-treatment rebound.

29150943,Muscle regeneration potential and satellite cell activation profile during recovery following hindlimb immobilization in mice.,"Reduced muscle activity leads to muscle atrophy and function loss in patients and animal models. Satellite cells (SCs) are postnatal muscle stem cells that play a pivotal role in skeletal muscle regeneration following injury. The regenerative potential, satellite cell numbers, and markers during recovery following immobilization of the hindlimb for 7 days were explored. In mice exposed to 7 days of hindlimb immobilization, in those exposed to recovery (7 days, splint removal), and in contralateral control muscles, muscle precursor cells were isolated from all hindlimb muscles (fluorescence-activated cell sorting, FACS) and SCs, and muscle regeneration were identified using immunofluorescence (gastrocnemius and soleus) and electron microscopy (EM, gastrocnemius). Expression of ki67, pax7, myoD, and myogenin was quantified (RT-PCR) from SC FACS yields. Body and grip strength were determined. Following 7 day hindlimb immobilization, a decline in SCs (FACS, immunofluorescence) was observed together with an upregulation of SC activation markers and signs of muscle regeneration including fusion to existing myofibers (EM). Recovery following hindlimb immobilization was characterized by a program of muscle regeneration events. Hindlimb immobilization induced a decline in SCs together with an upregulation of markers of SC activation, suggesting that fusion to existing myofibers takes place during unloading.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult ITP patients treated with romiplostim in four Canadian centers. Patients had primary or secondary ITP and were followed for 1 year before starting weekly romiplostim treatment. We compared IVIG use, clinical outcomes, and cost before and after romiplostim. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with ITP received romiplostim. Median age was 54 years (interquartile range [IQR], 45-63 years) and patients had a median of two prior ITP treatments (IQR, 1-4) including splenectomy (n = 7). Median platelet (PLT) count was 23 x 10(9) before and 124 x 10(9) after romiplostim. Median duration of romiplostim treatment was 3.7 months. Patients used a median of two IVIG infusions per year before and 0.7 per year after starting romiplostim (p = 0.16). For patients who received weekly romiplostim for at least 1 month (n = 19), IVIG infusions were three (IQR, 1-5) per year before and 0.7 (IQR, 0.4-1.6) per year after romiplostim.

36928568,Prognostic value of deep learning-based fibrosis quantification on chest CT in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,"To investigate the prognostic value of deep learning (DL)-driven CT fibrosis quantification in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
Patients diagnosed with IPF who underwent nonenhanced chest CT and spirometry between 2005 and 2009 were retrospectively collected. Proportions of normal (CT-Norm%) and fibrotic lung volume (CT-Fib%) were calculated on CT using the DL software. The correlations of CT-Norm% and CT-Fib% with forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (D<sub>LCO</sub>) were evaluated. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of CT-Norm% and CT-Fib% for overall survival were calculated with clinical and physiologic variables as covariates using Cox regression. The feasibility of substituting CT-Norm% for D<sub>LCO</sub> in the GAP index was investigated using time-dependent areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (TD-AUCs) at 3 years.
In total, 161 patients (median age [IQR], 68 [62-73] years; 104 men) were evaluated.

Normal and fibrotic lung volume proportions (hazard ratios, 0.98 and 1.04; both p  0.001) independently predicted overall survival when adjusted for clinical and physiologic variables.",[],0
29177536,Novel biotechnological platform based on baculovirus occlusion bodies carrying Babesia bovis small antigenic peptides for the design of a diagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).,"Baculoviruses are large DNA virus of insects principally employed in recombinant protein expression. Its ability to form occlusion bodies (OBs), which are composed mainly of polyhedrin protein (POLH), makes them biotechnologically attractive, as these crystals (polyhedra) can incorporate foreign peptides and can be easily isolated. On the other hand, peptide microarrays allow rapid and inexpensive high-throughput serological screening of new candidates to be incorporated to OBs. To integrate these 2 biotechnological approaches, we worked on Babesia bovis, one of the causative agents of bovine babesiosis. Current molecular diagnosis of infection with B. bovis includes enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques, which use merozoite lysate obtained from infected bovine erythrocytes. However, it is important to produce recombinant antigens that replace the use of crude antigens. Here, we describe a new biotechnological platform for the design of indirect ELISAs based on 5 antigenic peptides of 15 amino acid residues of B. bovis (ApBb), selected from a peptide microarray and expressed as a fusion to POLH. An Sf9POLHE44G packaging cell line infected with recombinant baculoviruses carrying POLH-ApBb fusions yielded higher levels of chimeric polyhedra, highlighting the advantage of a trans-contribution of a mutant copy of polyhedrin. Finally, the use of dissolved recombinant polyhedra as antigens was successful in an ELISA assay, as B. bovis-positive sera recognized the fusion POLH-ApBb. Thus, the use of this platform resulted in a promising alternative for molecular diagnosis of relevant infectious diseases.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\29177536.txt,0,"Baculoviruses are large DNA virus of insects principally employed in recombinant protein expression.

24616478,Metabolic reprogramming is required for antibody production that is suppressed in anergic but exaggerated in chronically BAFF-exposed B cells.,"B cell activation leads to proliferation and Ab production that can protect from pathogens or promote autoimmunity. Regulation of cell metabolism is essential to support the demands of lymphocyte growth and effector function and may regulate tolerance. In this study, we tested the regulation and role of glucose uptake and metabolism in the proliferation and Ab production of control, anergic, and autoimmune-prone B cells. Control B cells had a balanced increase in lactate production and oxygen consumption following activation, with proportionally increased glucose transporter Glut1 expression and mitochondrial mass upon either LPS or BCR stimulation. This contrasted with metabolic reprogramming of T cells, which had lower glycolytic flux when resting but disproportionately increased this pathway upon activation. Importantly, tolerance greatly affected B cell metabolic reprogramming. Anergic B cells remained metabolically quiescent, with only a modest increase in glycolysis and oxygen consumption with LPS stimulation. B cells chronically stimulated with elevated BAFF, however, rapidly increased glycolysis and Ab production upon stimulation. Induction of glycolysis was critical for Ab production, as glycolytic inhibition with the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate sharply suppressed B cell proliferation and Ab secretion in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, B cell-specific deletion of Glut1 led to reduced B cell numbers and impaired Ab production in vivo. Together, these data show that activated B cells require Glut1-dependent metabolic reprogramming to support proliferation and Ab production that is distinct from T cells and that this glycolytic reprogramming is regulated in tolerance.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\24616478.txt,0,"B cell activation leads to proliferation and Ab production that can protect from pathogens or promote autoimmunity.

30885150,The small molecule Bcl-2/Mcl-1 inhibitor TW-37 shows single-agent cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma cell lines.,"BACKGROUND: High-risk neuroblastoma with N-Myc amplification remains a therapeutic challenge in paediatric oncology. Antagonism of pro-death Bcl-2 homology (BH) proteins to pro-survival BH members such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 has become a treatment approach, but previous studies suggest that a combined inhibition of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 is necessary. TW-37 inhibits Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 with almost the same affinity. However, single-agent cytotoxicity of TW-37 in neuroblastoma cell lines has not been investigated. METHODS: Cell viability, apoptosis, proliferation and changes in growth properties were determined in SKNAS, IMR-5, SY5Y and Kelly cells after treatment with TW-37. After transfection with Mcl-1 or Bcl-2 siRNA, apoptosis and proliferation were investigated in Kelly cells. Mice with Kelly cell line xenografts were treated with TW-37 and tumor growth, survival and apoptosis were determined. RESULTS: Cell lines with N-Myc amplification were more sensitive to TW-37 treatment, IC50 values for IMR-5 and Kelly cells being 0.28 muM and 0.22 muM, compared to SY5Y cells and SKNAS cells (IC50 0.96 muM and 0.83 muM). Treatment with TW-37 resulted in increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation rates, especially in IMR5 and Kelly cells. Bcl-2 as well as Mcl-1 knockdown induced apoptosis in Kelly cells. TW-37 led to a decrease in tumor growth and a favorable survival (p = 0.0379) in a Kelly neuroblastoma xenografts mouse model. CONCLUSION: TW-37 has strong single-agent cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, combined inhibition of Bcl-2/Mcl-1 by TW-37 in N-Myc amplified neuroblastoma may represent an interesting therapeutic strategy.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\30885150.txt,1,"BACKGROUND: High-risk neuroblastoma with N-Myc amplification remains a therapeutic challenge in paediatric oncology.

24795088,High-quality DNA from fingernails for genetic analysis.,"The availability of high-quality germline DNA is an important prerequisite for a variety of genetic analyses. We have shown previously that fingernail clippings provide an optimal source of autologous, constitutional DNA for PCR-based applications. However, most existing protocols for nucleic acid purification from nails do not provide sufficiently high yields of pure and intact DNA for more demanding downstream analyses such as next generation sequencing (NGS). We have extensively tested and systematically modified a number of different protocols for DNA purification from nail material to optimize the yield and quality. The integrity of DNA was determined by PCR amplification of short (<300 bp), mid-range (>400 bp), and long-range (>2 kb) sequences using different target genes. Among the methods tested, the Prepfiler Forensic DNA Extraction kit was identified as the most appropriate approach to isolation of high-quality DNA from nail clippings. A standardized input of 20 mg nail material (1 to 10 pieces of fingernail clippings) yielded a mean of 1 mug DNA (range, 0.5 to 2.3 mug). Subsequent PCR-analysis revealed efficient amplifiability of short and mid-range targets in 93% and 90%, and long-range fragments in 60% of the samples tested.

30900388,Measurable residual disease monitoring using Wilms tumor gene 1 expression in childhood acute myeloid leukemia based on child-specific reference values.,"BACKGROUND: Measurable/minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring can predict imminent hematological relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The majority of childhood AML patients do not harbor fusion genes or mutations applicable as MRD markers and overexpression of Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) may constitute a useful monitoring target. However, age-specific reference values in healthy hematopoiesis and standardization of WT1 assessment are prerequisites for clinical utility. PROCEDURE: We investigated WT1 expression across age in hematologically healthy controls (n = 109), during suspected infection (n = 90) and bone marrow (BM) regeneration (n = 13). WT1 expression in AML at diagnosis (n = 91) and during follow-up (n = 30) was compared with age-specific reference values. RESULTS: WT1 expression correlated with age and showed higher levels in both BM and peripheral blood (PB) in children compared with adults (P < 0.001 and P = 0.01). WT1 expression from healthy hematopoiesis was lower in PB compared with BM (WT1BM /WT1PB  = 8.6, 95% CI: 5.3-13.7) and not influenced by infection nor BM regeneration. At AML diagnosis, 66% had more than 20-fold WT1 overexpression in PB or BM (PB 74%; BM 45%). WT1 was quantified in 279 PB samples during follow-up. All 11 patients with PB sampling within 4 months of disease recurrence displayed WT1 overexpression by a median of 1.9 months (range, 0.7-9.7) before hematological relapse. CONCLUSIONS: This study defines child-specific reference values for WT1 expression in healthy hematopoiesis and demonstrates that WT1 expression in PB is a useful post-treatment monitoring tool in childhood AML.

Several methods for the classification of nodal-positive lung cancer have been proposed. However, classification considering the impact of targetable genetic variants are lacking. The possibility of genetic variants for the better stratification of nodal positive lung adenocarcinoma was estimated. METHODS: Mutations of 36 genes between primary sites and metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) were compared using next-generation sequencing. Subsequently, mutations in EGFR and BRAF, rearrangements in ALK and ROS1 were evaluated in 69 resected pN1-2M0 adenocarcinoma cases. Recurrence-free survival (RFS), post-recurrence survival (PRS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated with respect to targetable variants and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after recurrence. RESULTS: About 90% of variants were shared and allele frequencies were similar between primary and metastatic sites. In 69 pN1-2M0 cases, EGFR/ALK were positive in primary sites of 39 cases and same EGFR/ALK variants were confirmed in metastatic LNs of 96.7% tissue-available cases. Multivariate analyses indicated positive EGFR/ALK status was associated with worse RFS (HR 2.366; 95% CI 1.244-4.500; P = 0.009), and PRS was prolonged in cases receiving TKI therapy (no post-recurrence TKI therapies, HR 3.740; 95% CI 1.449-9.650; P = 0.006).

RESULTS: PRSS3 was significantly upregulated in GC tissues, and PRSS3 protein levels were higher in tumors that developed metastases soon after the surgery compared with those that remained metastasis-free. High expression of PRSS3 was associated with tumor N staging and independently predictive of postoperative prognosis in patients with GC. The V1 variant of PRSS3 was primarily detected in GC tissue and cell lines, the others (V2-V4) being scarcely detectable.

The addition of BRCA1/2 genetic testing as a companion diagnostic tool to the health insurance coverage is of considerable significance as a spearhead of health insurance medical care for all different types of hereditary tumors. However, several problems related to this companion diagnostic test have emerged, including the estab- lishment of a genetic counseling system and handling of BRCA1/2 genetic tests performed at the patients' own expense. In addition, the purpose of the companion diagnostic test is to confirm drug indication in a case. However, since the test results include the diagnosis of hereditary tumors, there is also an urgent need to improve the medical care system and social environment for family members of patients with pathological mutations.

27558955,Molecular hydrogen suppresses activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.,"Molecular hydrogen (H2) is effective for many diseases. However, molecular bases of H2 have not been fully elucidated. Cumulative evidence indicates that H2 acts as a gaseous signal modulator. We found that H2 suppresses activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by promoting phosphorylation and degradation omicronf beta-catenin. Either complete inhibition of GSK3 or mutations at CK1- and GSK3-phosphorylation sites of beta-catenin abolished the suppressive effect of H2. H2 did not increase GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, indicating that H2 has no direct effect on GSK3 itself. Knock-down of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or Axin1, which form the beta-catenin degradation complex, minimized the suppressive effect of H2 on beta-catenin accumulation. Accordingly, the effect of H2 requires CK1/GSK3-phosphorylation sites of beta-catenin, as well as the beta-catenin degradation complex comprised of CK1, GSK3, APC, and Axin1. We additionally found that H2 reduces the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Oral intake of H2 water tended to ameliorate cartilage degradation in a surgery-induced rat osteoarthritis model through attenuating beta-catenin accumulation. We first demonstrate that H2 suppresses abnormally activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which accounts for the protective roles of H2 in a fraction of diseases.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\27558955.txt,0,"Molecular hydrogen (H2) is effective for many diseases.

We extracted data for elderly patients who were admitted with C2 odontoid fracture and treated with at least one of the three procedures (halo-vest immobilization, ASF, or PSF) during hospitalization. We conducted a generalized propensity score-based matching weight analysis to compare in-hospital mortality among the three procedures. We further investigated independent risk factors for in-hospital death. The study involved 891 patients (halo-vest, n = 463; ASF, n = 74; and PSF, n = 354) with a mean age of 78 years.

Because of its diverse nature, its identification is extremely difficult and expensive. On the genomic and proteomic landscape of Ph-like ALL patients, there is a paucity of published literature from developing countries.
The authors used digital barcoded nCounter NanoString gene expression profiling for its detection, followed by molecular and proteomic characterization using fluorescence in situ hybridization and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
The authors found 32.05% Ph-like ALL patients and their median age at presentation was considerably higher than Ph-negative ALL cases (p = .0306). Furthermore, we identified 20% CRLF2 overexpressed cases having 8.33% CRLF2-IGH translocation with concomitant R683S mutation and 8.33% CRLF2-P2RY8 translocation. In 80% of CRLF2 downregulated cases, we identified 10% as having JAK2 rearrangement. Minimal residual disease-positivity was more common in Ph-like ALL cases (55.55% vs. 25% in Ph-negative ALL cases).

37581253,Diagnosis and Management of Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy: Role of Multimodality Cardiac Imaging. A Scientific Statement of the Heart Failure Association of the ESC.,"Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy consists in an increased LV wall thickness. LV hypertrophy can be either secondary, in response to pressure or volume overload, or primary, i.e., not explained solely by abnormal loading conditions. Primary LV hypertrophy may be due to gene mutations or to the deposition or storage of abnormal substances in the extracellular spaces or within the cardiomyocytes (more appropriately defined as pseudohypertrophy). LV hypertrophy is often a precursor to subsequent development of heart failure. Cardiovascular imaging plays a key role in the assessment of LV hypertrophy. Echocardiography, the first-line imaging technique, allows a comprehensive assessment of LV systolic and diastolic function. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance provides added value as it measures accurately LV and right ventricular volumes and mass and characterizes myocardial tissue properties, which may provide important clues to the final diagnosis. Additionally, scintigraphy with bone tracers is included in the diagnostic algorithm of cardiac amyloidosis. Once the diagnosis is established, imaging findings may help predict future disease evolution and inform therapy and follow-up.

25468659,Loss of function in heparan sulfate elongation genes EXT1 and EXT 2 results in improved nitric oxide bioavailability and endothelial function.,"BACKGROUND: Heparanase is the major enzyme involved in degradation of endothelial heparan sulfates, which is associated with impaired endothelial nitric oxide synthesis. However, the effect of heparan sulfate chain length in relation to endothelial function and nitric oxide availability has never been investigated. We studied the effect of heterozygous mutations in heparan sulfate elongation genes EXT1 and EXT2 on endothelial function in vitro as well as in vivo. METHODS AND RESULT: Flow-mediated dilation, a marker of nitric oxide bioavailability, was studied in Ext1(+/-) and Ext2(+/-) mice versus controls (n=7 per group), as well as in human subjects with heterozygous loss of function mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 (n=13 hereditary multiple exostoses and n=13 controls). Endothelial function was measured in microvascular endothelial cells under laminar flow with or without siRNA targeting EXT1 or EXT2. Endothelial glycocalyx and maximal arteriolar dilatation were significantly altered in Ext1(+/-) and Ext2(+/-) mice compared to wild-type littermates (glycocalyx: wild-type 0.67+-0.1 mum, Ext1(+/-) 0.28+-0.1 mum and Ext2(+/-) 0.25+-0.1 mum, P<0.01, maximal arteriolar dilation during reperfusion: wild-type 11.3+-1.0%), Ext1(+/-) 15.2+-1.4% and Ext2(+/-) 13.8+-1.6% P<0.05).

However, the effect of heparan sulfate chain length in relation to endothelial function and nitric oxide availability has never been investigated. We studied the effect of heterozygous mutations in heparan sulfate elongation genes EXT1 and EXT2 on endothelial function in vitro as well as in vivo. METHODS AND RESULT: Flow-mediated dilation, a marker of nitric oxide bioavailability, was studied in Ext1(-) and Ext2(-) mice versus controls (n7 per group), as well as in human subjects with heterozygous loss of function mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 (n13 hereditary multiple exostoses and n13 controls). Endothelial function was measured in microvascular endothelial cells under laminar flow with or without siRNA targeting EXT1 or EXT2. Endothelial glycocalyx and maximal arteriolar dilatation were significantly altered in Ext1(-) and Ext2(-) mice compared to wild-type littermates (glycocalyx: wild-type 0.67-0.1 mum, Ext1(-) 0.28-0.1 mum and Ext2(-) 0.25-0.1 mum, P0.01, maximal arteriolar dilation during reperfusion: wild-type 11.3-1.0), Ext1(-) 15.2-1.4 and Ext2(-) 13.8-1.6 P0.05).

29411231,Analysis of Chronic Granulomatous Disease in the Kavkazi Population in Israel Reveals Phenotypic Heterogeneity in Patients with the Same NCF1 mutation (c.579G>A).,"PURPOSE: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an innate immune deficiency disorder of phagocytes, resulting from mutations in the components of the NADPH oxidase complex that impair the synthesis of oxygen radicals, thus rendering patients susceptible to recurrent infections and excessive hyperinflammatory responses. The most common autosomal recessive form of CGD is p47phox deficiency, which is often clinically milder than the more common X-linked recessive form. Here, we report data on genetics, clinical and biochemical findings in 17 CGD patients of Kavkazi origin with the nonsense mutation c.579G>A in the NCF1 gene, leading to p47phox deficiency. METHODS: Diagnosis was based on detailed clinical evaluation, respiratory burst activity by cytochrome c reduction and dihydrorhodamine-1,2,3 (DHR) assay by flow cytometry, expression of p47phox by immunoblotting and molecular confirmation by DNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twelve male and five female patients with median age at onset of 2.5 years (range 1 day to 9 years) were included in the study. The present cohort displays an encouraging 88% overall long-term survival, with median follow-up of 17 years. Clinical manifestations varied from mild to severe expression of the disease. Correlation between genotype and phenotype is unpredictable, although the Kavkazi patients were more severely affected than other patients with p47phox deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Kavkazi CGD patients harbor a common genetic mutation that is associated with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype. Early diagnosis and proper clinical management in an experienced phagocytic leukocyte center is imperative to ensure favorable patient outcome.

24626649,Adult mastocytosis: a review of the Santo Antonio Hospital 's experience and an evaluation of World Health Organization criteria for the diagnosis of systemic disease.,"BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is a clonal disorder characterized by the accumulation of abnormal mast cells in the skin and/or in extracutaneous organs. OBJECTIVES: To present all cases of mastocytosis seen in the Porto Hospital Center and evaluate the performance of World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for systemic disease. METHODS: The cases of twenty-four adult patients with mastocytosis were reviewed. Their clinical and laboratorial characteristics were assessed, and the properties of the criteria used to diagnose systemic mastocytosis were evaluated. RESULTS: The age of disease onset ranged from 2 to 75 years. Twenty-three patients had cutaneous involvement and 75% were referred by dermatologists. Urticaria pigmentosa was the most common manifestation of the disease. One patient with severe systemic mast cell mediator-related symptoms showed the activating V560G KIT mutation. The bone marrow was examined in 79% of patients, and mast cell immunophenotyping was performed in 67% of the participants. Systemic disease was detected in 84% of cases, and 81% of the sample had elevated serum tryptase levels. All the diagnostic criteria for systemic mastocytosis had high specificity and positive predictive value. Bone marrow biopsy had the lowest sensitivity, negative predictive value and efficiency, while the highest such values were observed for mast cell immunophenotyping. Patients were treated with regimens including antihistamines, sodium cromoglycate, alpha-interferon, hydroxyurea and phototherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous involvement is often seen in adult mastocytosis patients, with most individuals presenting with indolent systemic disease. Although serum tryptase levels are a good indicator of mast cell burden, bone marrow biopsy should also be performed in patients with normal serum tryptase, with flow cytometry being the most adequate method to diagnose systemic disease.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\24626649.txt,0,"BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is a clonal disorder characterized by the accumulation of abnormal mast cells in the skin andor in extracutaneous organs.

To facilitate this process, the NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) has assembled Variant Curation Expert Panels (VCEPs), groups of experts and biocurators which provide gene- and disease- specifications to the American College of Medical Genetics & Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology's (ACMG/AMP) variation classification guidelines. With the goal of classifying the clinical significance of GAA variants in Pompe disease (Glycogen storage disease, type II), the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases (LD) VCEP has specified the ACMG/AMP criteria for GAA. Variant classification can play an important role in confirming the diagnosis of Pompe disease as well as in the identification of carriers. Furthermore, since the inclusion of Pompe disease on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) for newborns in the USA in 2015, the addition of molecular genetic testing has become an important component in the interpretation of newborn screening results, particularly for asymptomatic individuals. To date, the LD VCEP has submitted classifications and supporting data on 243 GAA variants to public databases, specifically ClinVar and the ClinGen Evidence Repository.

36343306,"In Multiple Myeloma, High-Risk Secondary Genetic Events Observed at Relapse Are Present From Diagnosis in Tiny, Undetectable Subclonal Populations.","Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by copy number abnormalities (CNAs), some of which influence patient outcomes and are sometimes observed only at relapse(s), suggesting their acquisition during tumor evolution. However, the presence of micro-subclones may be missed in bulk analyses. Here, we use single-cell genomics to determine how often these high-risk events are missed at diagnosis and selected at relapse.
We analyzed 81 patients with plasma cell dyscrasias using single-cell CNA sequencing. Sixty-six patients were selected at diagnosis, nine at first relapse, and six in presymptomatic stages. A total of 956 newly diagnosed patients with MM and patients with first relapse MM have been identified retrospectively with required cytogenetic data to evaluate enrichment of CNA risk events and survival impact.
A total of 52,176 MM cells were analyzed. Seventy-four patients (91%) had 2-16 subclones. Among these patients, 28.7% had a subclone with high-risk features (del(17p), del(1p32), and 1q gain) at diagnosis. In a patient with a subclonal 1q gain at diagnosis, we analyzed the diagnosis, postinduction, and first relapse samples, which showed a rise of the high-risk 1q gain subclone (16%, 70%, and 92%, respectively). In our clinical database, we found that the 1q gain frequency increased from 30.2% at diagnosis to 43.6% at relapse (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.00). We subsequently performed survival analyses, which showed that the progression-free and overall survival curves were superimposable between patients who had the 1q gain from diagnosis and those who seemingly acquired it at relapse. This strongly suggests that many patients had 1q gains at diagnosis in microclones that were missed by bulk analyses.

26291959,Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for CD40 Ligand Deficiency: Single Institution Experience.,"BACKGROUND: X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (X-HIGM) due to mutations in the gene encoding CD40 ligand results in failure of Ig class switching and an increased propensity for recurrent sinopulmonary and other infections, and thus decreased life expectancy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative, but long-term follow-up data are limited. PROCEDURES: We conducted a retrospective analysis of seven patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT for HIGM syndrome at Duke University Medical Center. RESULTS: Median age at transplant was 5.2 years (range 0.7-19.3). None of the patients had active hepatic or pulmonary disease immediately prior to transplant, but all had a history of serious infections. Five patients received myeloablative conditioning, and two patients received reduced intensity conditioning. Graft sources included bone marrow, peripheral blood, and unrelated umbilical cord blood. Post-transplantation complications included veno-occlusive disease, hemorrhagic cystitis, adenoviremia, and cryptosporidium recurrence in one patient each. Two patients developed acute GVHD grades II-IV that resolved promptly with treatment and none developed extensive chronic GVHD. All patients are intravenous IgG-independent and 6/7 have normal antibody titers. Immunoglobulin (Ig) A levels normalized in all but one patient and T and B cell numbers and function are otherwise normal in all. All patients are alive at a median follow-up of 9.7 (range 9.7-16.1) years post-transplantation with predominantly donor chimerism and no recurrent infections.

29370381,Ablation of Grb10 Specifically in Muscle Impacts Muscle Size and Glucose Metabolism in Mice.,"Grb10 is an adaptor-type signaling protein most highly expressed in tissues involved in insulin action and glucose metabolism, such as muscle, pancreas, and adipose. Germline deletion of Grb10 in mice creates a phenotype with larger muscles and improved glucose homeostasis. However, it has not been determined whether Grb10 ablation specifically in muscle is sufficient to induce hypermuscularity or affect whole body glucose metabolism. In this study we generated muscle-specific Grb10-deficient mice (Grb10-mKO) by crossing Grb10flox/flox mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the human alpha-skeletal actin promoter. One-year-old Grb10-mKO mice had enlarged muscles, with greater cross-sectional area of fibers compared with wild-type (WT) mice. This degree of hypermuscularity did not affect whole body glucose homeostasis under basal conditions. However, hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp studies revealed that Grb10-mKO mice had greater glucose uptake into muscles compared with WT mice. Insulin signaling was increased at the level of phospho-Akt in muscle of Grb10-mKO mice compared with WT mice, consistent with a role of Grb10 as a modulator of proximal insulin receptor signaling.

A typical requirement for multiplex IHC (mIHC) is the use of different animal species for each primary (1 Ab) and secondary (2 Ab) antibody pair. Although 1 Abs from different species have been used with differently labeled species-specific 2 Abs, quite often the appropriate combination of antibodies is not available. More recently, sequential detection of multiple antigens using 1 Abs from the same species used a microwaving treatment between successive antigen detection cycles to elute previously bound 1 Ab/2 Ab complex and therefore to prevent the cross-reactivity of anti-species 2 Abs used in subsequent detection cycles. We present here a fully automated 1 Ab/2 Ab complex heat deactivation (HD) method on Ventana's BenchMark ULTRA slide stainer. This method is applied to detection using fluorophore-conjugated tyramide deposited on the tissue and takes advantage of the strong covalent bonding of the detection substrate to the tissue, preventing its elution in the HD process. The HD process was characterized for (1) effectiveness in preventing Ab cross-reactivity, (2) impact on the epitopes and (3) impact on the fluorophores.

Additionally, a better understanding of the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of metastatic tumors is needed. METHODS: Seven cases of ovarian metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma from 2013 to 2017 at our institute were investigated. The results were combined with those found in literature review. A total of 16 cases were analyzed in the present study. We examined clinicopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics, further detected ALK rearrangement by FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), and assessed EGFR and KRAS mutations using Sanger sequencing or the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 44.6 years (range, 33-56 years). Eleven of sixteen patients developed ovarian tumors within a mean time of 18.5 months (range, 5-48 months) from the initial diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma; 5 patients had lung tumors and ovarian masses simultaneously. Five tumors (5/16, 31%) occurred in the bilateral ovaries, and the others were unilateral ovarian tumors (11/16, 69%). All seven cases from our institute were positive for TTF-1 and Napsin A but negative for PAX8. In four cases, ALK (D5F3) was diffusely and strongly expressed, with ALK rearrangements (4/7, 57%). Overall, ALK rearrangement was found by FISH or immunohistochemistry in 11/16 (69%) cases. In two cases, EGFR mutations in exons 19 and 21, respectively, were found. One patient did not detected EGFR or ALK mutation in the metastatic tumor, but the primary lung adenocarcinoma did harbor an EGFR mutation. Two cases had no alterations in three genes above. Although the mean survival time of the patients with ALK rearrangement was longer than those without (mean survival time 25 m vs. 20 m), no statistical significance of the difference was found. CONCLUSIONS: As the largest case series of ovarian metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma, our findings indicate that ALK rearrangement is the most common molecular alteration. Although patients with ALK rearrangement appear to have a better prognosis than do those without ALK rearrangement, more cases with longer follow-up and multivariant analysis are needed to clarify this point.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31455365.txt,1,"BACKGROUND: Ovarian metastatic tumors from lung adenocarcinoma are rare, and a serial study of these tumors is lacking to date.

METHODS: Seven cases of ovarian metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma from 2013 to 2017 at our institute were investigated. The results were combined with those found in literature review. A total of 16 cases were analyzed in the present study. We examined clinicopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics, further detected ALK rearrangement by FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), and assessed EGFR and KRAS mutations using Sanger sequencing or the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 44.6 years (range, 33-56 years). Eleven of sixteen patients developed ovarian tumors within a mean time of 18.5 months (range, 5-48 months) from the initial diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma; 5 patients had lung tumors and ovarian masses simultaneously. Five tumors (516, 31) occurred in the bilateral ovaries, and the others were unilateral ovarian tumors (1116, 69). All seven cases from our institute were positive for TTF-1 and Napsin A but negative for PAX8. In four cases, ALK (D5F3) was diffusely and strongly expressed, with ALK rearrangements (47, 57). Overall, ALK rearrangement was found by FISH or immunohistochemistry in 1116 (69) cases. In two cases, EGFR mutations in exons 19 and 21, respectively, were found. One patient did not detected EGFR or ALK mutation in the metastatic tumor, but the primary lung adenocarcinoma did harbor an EGFR mutation. Two cases had no alterations in three genes above. Although the mean survival time of the patients with ALK rearrangement was longer than those without (mean survival time 25 m vs. 20 m), no statistical significance of the difference was found. CONCLUSIONS: As the largest case series of ovarian metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma, our findings indicate that ALK rearrangement is the most common molecular alteration. Although patients with ALK rearrangement appear to have a better prognosis than do those without ALK rearrangement, more cases with longer follow-up and multivariant analysis are needed to clarify this point.",['tumor'],1

30908670,Somatic alterations detected in diagnostic prostate biopsies provide an inadequate representation of multifocal prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The majority of clinical prostate cancers are multifocal with morphological and molecular heterogeneity. Adequate tissue representation is crucial for the clinical utility of multigene panel sequencing of core needle biopsies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genomic heterogeneity in multifocal prostate cancer and to analyze how representative preoperative biopsies are of spatially separated tumor foci. METHODS: We analyzed at least 2 tumor foci and 1 to 3 preoperative biopsy cores from 11 patients. Diagnostic biopsies, as well as fresh frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, from major tumor foci of radical prostatectomy specimens were macrodissected for the enrichment of tumor tissue. DNA was extracted and sequenced. We analyzed structural alterations, mutations, and copy number variations and compared the genomic profiles of tumor foci with those of preoperative biopsies. RESULTS: Alterations were rarely shared between foci, indicating a high degree of genomic heterogeneity. In 8 of 11 men at least 1 tumor focus was represented by the biopsies defined as harboring at least 1 common clonal somatic event. In only one case, somatic alterations from two spatially separate tumors were identified in the biopsies. Of the mutations and structural variants detected in fresh frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostatectomy material, only an average of 19% (range 0-44) and 55% (range 0-100), respectively, were found in preoperative biopsies where a common somatic origin was established. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocal prostate cancer is a somatically heterogeneous disease in which systematic needle biopsies do not provide sufficient molecular representation of the somatic alterations detected in spatially distinct tumor areas.

Assessments of genetic/genomic variants in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have generated great enthusiasm for their potential application as clinically actionable biomarkers in the management of early-stage breast cancer.Experimental Design: In this study, 861 serial plasma and matched tissue specimens from 102 patients with early-stage breast cancer who need chemotherapy and 50 individuals with benign breast tumors were deeply sequenced via next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques using large gene panels. RESULTS: Cancer tissues in this cohort of patients showed profound intratumor heterogeneities (ITHGs) that were properly reflected by ctDNA testing. Integrating the ctDNA detection rate of 74.2% in this cohort with the corresponding predictive results based on Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System classification (BI-RADS) could increase the positive predictive value up to 92% and potentially dramatically reduce surgical overtreatment. Patients with positive ctDNA after surgery showed a higher percentage of lymph node metastasis, indicating potential recurrence and remote metastasis. The ctDNA-positive rates were significantly decreased after chemotherapy in basal-like and Her2+ tumor subtypes, but were persistent despite chemotherapy in luminal type. The tumor mutation burden in blood (bTMB) assessed on the basis of ctDNA testing was positively correlated with the TMB in tumor tissues (tTMB), providing a candidate biomarker warranting further study of its potentials used for precise immunotherapy in cancer.

30952820,The Impact of Brain Metastases and Associated Neurocognitive Aspects on Health Utility Scores in EGFR Mutated and ALK Rearranged NSCLC: A Real World Evidence Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: In lung cancer, brain metastases (BM) and their treatment are associated with high economic burden and inferior health-related quality of life. In the era of targeted therapy, real world evidence through health utility scores (HUS) is critical for economic analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort study (2014-2016), outpatients with stage IV lung cancer completed demographic and EQ-5D-3L surveys (to derive HUS). Health states and clinicopathologic variables were obtained from chart abstraction. Patients were categorized by the presence or absence of BM; regression analyses identified factors that were associated with HUS. A subset of patients prospectively completed neurocognitive function (NCF) tests and/or the FACT-brain (FACT-Br) questionnaire, which were then correlated with HUS (Spearman coefficients; regression analyses). RESULTS: Of 519 patients with 1,686 EQ-5D-3L-derived HUS, 94 (18%) completed NCF tests and 107 (21%) completed FACT-Br; 301 (58%) never developed BM, 24 (5%) developed first BM during study period, and 194 (37%) had BM at study entry. The sample was enriched (46%) for EGFR mutations (EGFRm) and ALK-rearrangements (ALKr). There were no HUS differences by BM status overall and in subsets by demographics. In multivariable analyses, superior HUS was associated with having EGFRm/ALKr (p < .0001), no prior radiation for extracranial disease (p < .001), and both intracranial (p = .002) and extracranial disease control (p < .01). HUS correlated with multiple elements of the FACT-Br and tests of NCF. CONCLUSION: Having BM in lung cancer is not associated with inferior HUS in a population enriched for EGFRm and ALKr. Patients exhibiting disease control and those with oncogene-addicted tumors have superior HUS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the setting of EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a diagnosis of brain metastases no longer consigns the patient to an inferior health state suggesting that new economic analyses in NSCLC are needed in the era of targeted therapies.

The index case's mother and three sons all carried the variant, but so far only the eldest son (age 18 years) presented with tall height. We hypothesized that the variant could constitute an activating mutation. DESIGN: The IGF1RR1353H variant was investigated in Igf1r-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (R-cells) by cell cycle, colony formation and transcriptome analyses. RESULTS: The IGF1RR1353H (R-1353) exhibited significantly increased cell proliferation, G1-S progression and colony formation in soft agar. RNA sequencing identified 195 differentially expressed genes between R-WT and R-1353 (adjusted P < 1E-100). Most genes were upregulated in R-1353, including the gene encoding the androgen receptor (AR). Gene expression profiling showed the most significant enrichment in extracellular matrix organization (P = 2.76E-7), collagen biosynthesis (P = 1.21E-5) and cell adhesion (P = 7.38E-5). Retrospective biochemical analysis of the index case revealed decreased testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin levels, whereas LH and FSH were within normal ranges. This profile suggests an increased sensitivity to androgen, which is compatible with the enhanced expression of Ar in R-1353 cells.

METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, we interrogated a prospectively collected institutional database for patients undergoing NSM who tested positive for BRCA1/2 mutations. Patient characteristics, preoperative details, and complications were evaluated. Digital mammogram was used to estimate the breast volume. RESULTS: From August 2009 to December 2017, 59 patients (2 males) with BRCA1/2 mutations underwent 114 NSMs. Ninety-two (80%) were risk-reduction surgeries. Thirty-two (28%) underwent single-stage reconstruction (24 autologous). The overall complication rate was 26.3% (N = 30), and 10.5% (N = 12) underwent unanticipated reoperation. 8.8% (N = 10) had full-thickness skin flap necrosis, 10.5% (N = 12) nipple necrosis, and 4.4% (N = 5) full-thickness nipple necrosis.

Utilizing the preoperative mammograms to estimate breast size may be more helpful than breast cup size in counseling preoperatively the risks of complications.",[],0
28347285,Whole-exome sequencing and digital PCR identified a novel compound heterozygous mutation in the NPHP1 gene in a case of Joubert syndrome and related disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition with autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance, which share a distinctive neuroradiological hallmark, the so-called molar tooth sign. JSRD is classified into six clinical subtypes based on associated variable multiorgan involvement. To date, 21 causative genes have been identified in JSRD, which makes genetic diagnosis difficult. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a case of a 28-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with JS with oculorenal defects with a novel compound heterozygous mutation (p.Ser219*/deletion) in the NPHP1 gene. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the patient identified the novel nonsense mutation in an apparently homozygous state. However, it was absent in her mother and heterozygous in her father. A read depth-based copy number variation (CNV) detection algorithm using WES data of the family predicted a large heterozygous deletion mutation in the patient and her mother, which was validated by digital polymerase chain reaction, indicating that the patient was compound heterozygous for the paternal nonsense mutation and the maternal deletion mutation spanning the site of the single nucleotide change. CONCLUSION: It should be noted that analytical pipelines that focus purely on sequence information cannot distinguish homozygosity from hemizygosity because of its inability to detect large deletions. The ability to detect CNVs in addition to single nucleotide variants and small insertion/deletions makes WES an attractive diagnostic tool for genetically heterogeneous disorders.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\28347285.txt,0,"BACKGROUND: Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition with autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance, which share a distinctive neuroradiological hallmark, the so-called molar tooth sign.

30963251,An update on the central nervous system manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that presents with variable phenotypes as a result of mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene and subsequently, abnormal function of the protein product, neurofibromin. Patients with NF1 are at increased risk for central nervous system (CNS) manifestations including structural, functional, and neoplastic disease. The mechanisms underlying the varied manifestations of NF1 are incompletely understood, but the loss of functional neurofibromin, resulting in sustained activation of the oncoprotein RAS, is responsible for tumorigenesis throughout the body, including the CNS. Much of our understanding of NF1-related CNS manifestations is from a combination of data from animal models and natural history studies of people with NF1 and CNS disease. Data from animal models suggest the importance of both Nf1 mutations and somatic genetic alterations, such as Tp53 loss, for development of neoplasms, as well as the role of the timing of the acquisition of such alterations on the variability of CNS manifestations. A variety of non-neoplastic structural (macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, aqueductal stenosis, and vasculopathy) and functional (epilepsy, impaired cognition, attention deficits, and autism spectrum disorder) abnormalities occur with variable frequency in individuals with NF1. In addition, there is increasing evidence that similar appearing CNS neoplasms in people with and without the NF1 syndrome are due to distinct oncogenic pathways. Gliomas in people with NF1 show alterations in the RAS/MAPK pathway, generally in the absence of BRAF alterations (common to sporadic pilocytic astrocytomas) or IDH or histone H3 mutations (common to diffuse gliomas subsets). A subset of low-grade astrocytomas in these patients remain difficult to classify using standard criteria, and occasionally demonstrate morphologic features resembling subependymal giant cell astrocytomas that afflict patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (""SEGA-like astrocytomas""). There is also emerging evidence that NF1-associated high-grade astrocytomas have frequent co-existing alterations such as ATRX mutations and an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype responsible for unique biologic properties. Ongoing efforts are seeking to improve diagnostic accuracy for CNS neoplasms in the setting of NF1 versus sporadic tumors. In addition, MEK inhibitors, which act on the RAS/MAPK pathway, continue to be studied as rational targets for the treatment of NF1-associated tumors, including CNS tumors.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\30963251.txt,1,"Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that presents with variable phenotypes as a result of mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene and subsequently, abnormal function of the protein product, neurofibromin.

31100235,Not All Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsies Are Equal: The Impact of the Type of Approach and Operator Expertise on the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The extensive use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has led to an even more widespread use of different targeted biopsy techniques and approaches. The best way of performing targeted biopsies and the effect of operator expertise have still to be defined. OBJECTIVE: To compare the rate of detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) of different mpMRI targeted approaches and to assess the role of operator expertise in the detection of csPCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 244 consecutive patients who underwent both 12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy and mpMRI targeted biopsy with either a cognitive biopsy (CB) or fusion biopsy (FB) approach during the same session between 2013 and 2016 at a single tertiary referral centre. INTERVENTION: All men underwent 1.5-T mpMRI with an endorectal coil. All biopsies were performed by three operators as their first cases of targeted biopsy. Lesions with a Prostate Imaging Recording and Data System (PI-RADS) v.2 score of >=3 detected at mpMRI were targeted. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: csPCa was defined as disease with a Gleason score at biopsy of >=7. Operator expertise was coded as the progressive number of targeted biopsies performed by each physician. Multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVA) were used to assess the association between the targeted biopsy technique (FB vs CB) and operator expertise for detection of csPCa. Covariates consisted of prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, PI-RADS v.2 (3 vs >3), number of targeted cores per MRI lesion, and digital rectal examination (negative vs positive). The same analyses were performed for patients undergoing FB only after accounting for the FB approach (transrectal vs transperineal). A lowess smoothing weighted function was used to graphically assess the effect of operator expertise on the probability of detecting csPCa, after accounting for all confounders. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 157 patients (64%) underwent FB and 87 (36%) underwent CB. The overall csPCa detection rate was 58% for FB and 45% for CB (p=0.07). A significantly higher rate of csPCa detection in targeted samples was observed for FB compared to CB (57% vs 36%; p=0.002). On MVA, FB and operator expertise were significantly associated with a higher probability of csPCa detection in targeted samples (odds ratio [OR] 2.4 and 1.7, respectively; both p<=0.03). When the same analyses were repeated for patients undergoing FB, operator expertise remained an independent predictor of csPCa detection (OR 1.9; p=0.004). An increase in the probability of detecting csPCa with the number of procedures performed was observed after accounting for all confounders. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that FB had higher detection rate than CB for csPCa. Moreover, operator expertise was significantly associated with higher detection rates for csPCa.

37407995,Protocadherin 20 maintains intestinal barrier function to protect against Crohn's disease by targeting ATF6.,"Intestinal barrier dysfunction plays a central role in the pathological onset of Crohn's disease. We identify the cadherin superfamily member protocadherin 20 (PCDH20) as a crucial factor in Crohn's disease. Here we describe the function of PCDH20 and its mechanisms in gut homeostasis, barrier integrity, and Crohn's disease development.
PCDH20 mRNA and protein expression is significantly downregulated in the colonic epithelium of Crohn's disease patients and mice with induced colitis compared with controls. In mice, intestinal-specific Pcdh20 knockout causes defects in enterocyte proliferation and differentiation, while causing morphological abnormalities. Specifically, the deletion disrupts barrier integrity by unzipping adherens junctions via β-catenin regulation and p120-catenin phosphorylation, thus aggravating colitis in DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis mouse models. Furthermore, we identify activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a key chaperone of endoplasmic reticulum stress, as a functional downstream effector of PCDH20. By administering a selective ATF6 activator, the impairment of intestinal barrier integrity and dysregulation of CHOP/β-catenin/p-p120-catenin pathway was reversed in Pcdh20-ablated mice with colitis and PCDH20-deficient colonic cell lines.

25160545,Early neurodevelopmental screening in tuberous sclerosis complex: a potential window of opportunity.,"BACKGROUND: Infants born with tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic condition resulting from a mutation in TSC1 or TSC2, are at increased risk for intellectual disability and/or autism. Features of epilepsy, neuropathology, genetics, as well as timing and type of mechanism-based medications have been proposed as risk factors. Neurodevelopmental outcomes have been reported among these studies; however, few include data about the individuals' early neurodevelopmental profile, a factor that may contribute significantly to these outcomes. Further, there is no clinical standard for the neurodevelopmental assessment of these infants. The paucity of data regarding the natural history of neurodevelopment in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex and the lack of a gold standard for neurodevelopmental evaluation present a significant challenge for clinicians and researchers. METHOD: During the first year of life, we tracked the onset of infantile spasms, the type and timing of antiepileptic treatments, and the associated response of two age-matched infants with tuberous sclerosis complex. We also employed Capute Scales as a part of a structured neurodevelopmental evaluation to characterize and compare their neurodevelopmental profiles. RESULTS: Infant 1 developed infantile spasms with confirmed hypsarrhythmia at 4 months of age. Treatment with vigabatrin was initiated within 24 hours with near immediate cessation of seizures and no further seizures to date. Expressive language delay was detected at 12 months and treated with speech and/or language therapy. Infant 2 developed complex partial seizures at 1 month. Treatment included levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and the ketogenic diet. Vigabatrin was initiated on detection of hypsarrhythmia after 4 months. Intractable epilepsy persists to date. Global developmental delay was evident by 8 months and treated with physical, occupational, and speech and/or language therapy. CONCLUSION: Many risk factors have been associated with intellectual disability and/or autism in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex; however, few data are available regarding practical clinical tools for early identification. In our case series, inclusion of the Capute Scales as a part of routine medical care led to the identification of developmental delays in the first 12 months of life and selection of targeted neurodevelopmental interventions. Development of a risk-based assessment using this approach will be the focus of future studies as it may provide a potential window of opportunity for both research and clinical purposes. In research, it may serve as an objective outcome measure. Clinically, this type of assessment has potential for informing clinical treatment decisions and serving as a prognostic indicator of long-term cognitive and psychiatric outcomes.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25160545.txt,0,"BACKGROUND: Infants born with tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic condition resulting from a mutation in TSC1 or TSC2, are at increased risk for intellectual disability andor autism.

Treatment with vigabatrin was initiated within 24 hours with near immediate cessation of seizures and no further seizures to date. Expressive language delay was detected at 12 months and treated with speech andor language therapy. Infant 2 developed complex partial seizures at 1 month. Treatment included levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and the ketogenic diet. Vigabatrin was initiated on detection of hypsarrhythmia after 4 months. Intractable epilepsy persists to date. Global developmental delay was evident by 8 months and treated with physical, occupational, and speech andor language therapy. CONCLUSION: Many risk factors have been associated with intellectual disability andor autism in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex; however, few data are available regarding practical clinical tools for early identification. In our case series, inclusion of the Capute Scales as a part of routine medical care led to the identification of developmental delays in the first 12 months of life and selection of targeted neurodevelopmental interventions. Development of a risk-based assessment using this approach will be the focus of future studies as it may provide a potential window of opportunity for both research and clinical purposes. In research, it may serve as an objective outcome measure. Clinically, this type of assessment has potential for informing clinical treatment decisions and serving as a prognostic indicator of long-term cognitive and psychiatric outcomes.",[],0
38326571,Genome-wide association study identifies human genetic variants associated with fatal outcome from Lassa fever.,"Infection with Lassa virus (LASV) can cause Lassa fever, a haemorrhagic illness with an estimated fatality rate of 29.7%, but causes no or mild symptoms in many individuals. Here, to investigate whether human genetic variation underlies the heterogeneity of LASV infection, we carried out genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as well as seroprevalence surveys, human leukocyte antigen typing and high-throughput variant functional characterization assays. We analysed Lassa fever susceptibility and fatal outcomes in 533 cases of Lassa fever and 1,986 population controls recruited over a 7 year period in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. We detected genome-wide significant variant associations with Lassa fever fatal outcomes near GRM7 and LIF in the Nigerian cohort. We also show that a haplotype bearing signatures of positive selection and overlapping LARGE1, a required LASV entry factor, is associated with decreased risk of Lassa fever in the Nigerian cohort but not in the Sierra Leone cohort.

31109278,A Computer - Aided Drug Designing for Pharmacological Inhibition of Mutant ALK for the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most common among all the types of cancer worldwide with 1.8 million people diagnosed every year, leading to 1.6 million deaths every year according to the American cancer society. The involvement of mutated Anaplasic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) positive fusion protein in the progression of NSCLC has made a propitious target to inhibit and treat NSCLC. In the present study, the main motif is to screen the most effective inhibitor against ALK protein with the potential pharmacological profile. The ligands selected were docked with Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) and CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) was the best docked pre-established compound with a permissible pharmacological profile. METHODS: The selected ligands were docked with Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD). With reference to the obtained compound with the lowest re-rank score, PubChem database was virtually screened to retrieve a large set of similar compounds which were docked to find the compound with higher affinity. Further comparative studies and in silico prediction included pharmacophore studies, proximity energy parameters, ADMET and BOILED-egg plot analysis. RESULTS: CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) was the best docked pre-established compound with preferable pharmacological profile and PubChem compound CID-123449015 came out as the most efficient virtually screened inhibitor. Interestingly, the contours of the virtual screened compound PubChem CID- 123449015 fall within our desired high volume cavity of protein having admirable property to control the ALK regulation to prevent carcinogenesis in NSCLC. BOILED-Egg plot analysis depicts that both the compounds have analogous characteristics in the divergent aspects. Moreover, in the evaluations of Blood Brain Barrier, Human Intestinal Absorption, AMES toxicity, and LD50, the virtually screened compound (PubChem CID-123449015) was found within high optimization. CONCLUSION: These investigations denote that the virtually screened compound (PubChem CID- 123449015) is more efficient to be a better prospective candidate for NSCLC treatment having good pharmacological profile than the pre-established compound CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) with low re-rank score.

31108964,Future Options of Molecular-Targeted Therapy in Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. With a focus on histology, there are two major subtypes: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (the more frequent subtype), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (the more aggressive one). Even though SCLC, in general, is a chemosensitive malignancy, relapses following induction therapy are frequent. The standard of care treatment of SCLC consists of platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with etoposide that is subsequently enhanced by PD-L1-inhibiting atezolizumab in the extensive-stage disease, as the addition of immune-checkpoint inhibition yielded improved overall survival. Although there are promising molecular pathways with potential therapeutic impacts, targeted therapies are still not an integral part of routine treatment. Against this background, we evaluated current literature for potential new molecular candidates such as surface markers (e.g., DLL3, TROP-2 or CD56), apoptotic factors (e.g., BCL-2, BET), genetic alterations (e.g., CREBBP, NOTCH or PTEN) or vascular markers (e.g., VEGF, FGFR1 or CD13). Apart from these factors, the application of so-called 'poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerases' (PARP) inhibitors can influence tumor repair mechanisms and thus offer new perspectives for future treatment. Another promising therapeutic concept is the inhibition of 'enhancer of zeste homolog 2' (EZH2) in the loss of function of tumor suppressors or amplification of (proto-) oncogenes.

Only very few examples of digenic inheritance have been described in the neuromuscular disease field. Here we show that predicted deleterious variants in SRPK3, encoding the X-linked serine/argenine protein kinase 3, lead to a progressive early onset skeletal muscle myopathy only when in combination with heterozygous variants in the TTN gene. The co-occurrence of predicted deleterious SRPK3/TTN variants was not seen among 76,702 healthy male individuals, and statistical modeling strongly supported digenic inheritance as the best-fitting model. Furthermore, double-mutant zebrafish (srpk3<sup>-/-</sup>; ttn.1<sup>+/-</sup>) replicated the myopathic phenotype and showed myofibrillar disorganization. Transcriptome data suggest that the interaction of srpk3 and ttn.1 in zebrafish occurs at a post-transcriptional level.

However, as FZD2 can activate both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, its precise functions and mechanisms of action in limb development are unclear. To address these questions, we generated mice harboring a single-nucleotide insertion in Fzd2 (Fzd2em1Smill), causing a frameshift mutation in the final Dishevelled-interacting domain. Fzd2em1Smill mutant mice had shortened limbs, resembling those of RS and OMOD2 patients, indicating that FZD2 mutations are causative.

Somatic mutation of tumor protein 53 (TP53) is a hallmark of tubo-ovarian HGSC and is observed in almost all such cases. Highly sensitive targeted genomic sequencing can be used to identify novel mutations that may become potential druggable targets and aid in therapeutic decisions. The aim of this study was to describe the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of HGSCs with novel somatic TP53 mutations identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A commercial NGS panel comprising 170 genes, including TP53, was used to analyze the genetic profiles of 132 ovarian carcinoma cases. The clinicopathological characteristics and p53 immunostaining results of two HGSCs exhibiting novel TP53 mutations were investigated.

Somatic mutation of tumor protein 53 (TP53) is a hallmark of tubo-ovarian HGSC and is observed in almost all such cases. Highly sensitive targeted genomic sequencing can be used to identify novel mutations that may become potential druggable targets and aid in therapeutic decisions. The aim of this study was to describe the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of HGSCs with novel somatic TP53 mutations identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A commercial NGS panel comprising 170 genes, including TP53, was used to analyze the genetic profiles of 132 ovarian carcinoma cases. The clinicopathological characteristics and p53 immunostaining results of two HGSCs exhibiting novel TP53 mutations were investigated. RESULTS: Eighty-eight (66.7) out of 132 ovarian carcinoma cases were diagnosed as HGSC.

36926333,"Unique profile on the progress free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the Qujing area, Southwest China.","China's southwestern region, Qujing, harbors a high incidence of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and related mortality. This study was designed to reveal the impact of an immune-related prognostic signature (IRPS) on advanced NSCLC in the Qujing.
Tissue specimens from an independent cohort of 37 patients with advanced NSCLC were retrospectively evaluated to determine the relationship between the IRPS estimated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and clinical outcome. To compare the IRPS in tissue and the clinical outcomes between Qujing and non-Qujing populations, we analyzed datasets of 23 patients with advanced NSCLC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, an independent cohort (n=111) of blood specimens was retrospectively analyzed to determine the relationship between the IRPS and clinical outcome. Finally, we evaluated the utility of the blood IRPS in classifying 24 patients with advanced NSCLC who might benefit from immunotherapy.
In cohort 1, the Qujing population with tTMB-H (≥ 10 mutations/Mb) or KRAS mutations had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37, 0.14 to 0.97, <i>P</i> = 0.04; HR 0.23, 0.08 to 0.66, <i>P</i> < 0.01) and overall survival (OS) (HR 0.05, 0.01 to 0.35, <i>P</i> < 0.01; HR 0.22, 0.07 to 0.66, <i>P</i> < 0.01). In cohort 2 of the Qujing population, bTMB-H (≥ 6 mutations per Mb) and KRAS mutations were related to PFS (HR 0.59, 0.36 to 0.99, <i>P</i> = 0.04; HR 0.50, 0.26 to 0.98, <i>P</i> = 0.04) and OS (HR 0.58, 0.35 to 0.96, <i>P</i> = 0.03; HR 0.48, 0.25 to 0.93, <i>P</i> = 0.03). Notably, the Qujing population with bTMB-H had superior PFS (HR 0.32, 0.09 to 1.09, <i>P</i> = 0.01), OS (HR 0.33, 0.10 to 1.13, <i>P</i> < 0.01) and objective response rates (ORRs) (83.3% vs. 14.3% vs. 20.0%, <i>P <</i>0.01) to immunotherapy than other populations.
These findings show that tTMB, bTMB and KRAS mutations appear to be independent validated IRPSs that predict the clinical outcomes of Qujing populations with advanced NSCLC and that bTMB may be used as a reliable IRPS to predict the clinical benefit from anti-PD-1 therapies among populations from Qujing with advanced NSCLC.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\36926333.txt,1,"Chinas southwestern region, Qujing, harbors a high incidence of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and related mortality.

31335885,Telomere length and its correlation with gene mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a Korean population.,"Telomere length (TL) is a prognostic indicator in Caucasian chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but its significance in Asian CLL remains unknown. To investigate the prognostic significance of TL and its correlation with cytogenetic aberrations and somatic mutations, we analyzed TL measurements at the cellular level by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in patients with CLL in Korea. The present study enrolled 110 patients (41 females and 69 males) diagnosed with CLL according to the World Health Organization criteria (2001-2017). TLs of bone marrow nucleated cells at the single-cell level were measured by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) in 71 patients. The correlations of TL with clinical characteristics, cytogenetic aberrations, genetic mutations, and overall survival were assessed. The median value of mean TL in CLL patients (T/C ratio 7.46 (range 1.19-18.14) was significantly shorter than that in the normal controls (T/C ratio 15.28 (range 8.59-24.93) (p < 0.001). Shorter TLs were associated with complex karyotypes (p = 0.030), del(11q22) (p = 0.023), presence of deletion and/or mutation in ATM and/or TP53 (p = 0.019), and SH2B3 mutation (p = 0.015). A shorter TL was correlated with lower hemoglobin levels and adverse survival (mean TL < 9.35, p = 0.021). When the proportion of cells with extremely short TLs (< 7.61) was greater than 90%, CLL patients showed poor survival (p = 0.002). Complex karyotypes, TP53 mutation, and the number of mutated genes were determined to be significant adverse variables by multivariable Cox analysis (p = 0.011, p = 0.002, and p = 0.002, respectively).

Predicting patient response prior to therapy would improve treatment effectiveness, avoid treatment-related adverse events and reduce healthcare costs. Three separate cohorts of MDS patients were used to simulate drug response to lenalidomide alone, hypomethylating agent (HMA) alone, or HMA plus lenalidomide. Utilizing a computational biology program, genomic abnormalities in each patient were used to create an intracellular pathway map that was then used to screen for drug response. In the lenalidomide treated cohort, computer modeling correctly matched clinical responses in 37/46 patients (80%). In the second cohort, 15 HMA patients were modeled and correctly matched to responses in 12 (80%). In the third cohort, computer modeling correctly matched responses in 10/10 patients (100%). This computational biology network approach identified GGH overexpression as a potential resistance factor to HMA treatment and paradoxical activation of beta-catenin (through Csnk1a1 inhibition) as a resistance factor to lenalidomide treatment.

30880225,A comprehensive study of epigenetic alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma identifies potential therapeutic targets.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: A causal link has recently been established between epigenetic alterations and hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating that epigenetic inhibition may have therapeutic potential. We aimed to identify and target epigenetic modifiers that show molecular alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We studied the molecular-clinical correlations of epigenetic modifiers including bromodomains, histone acetyltransferases, lysine methyltransferases and lysine demethylases in HCC using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data of 365 patients with HCC. The therapeutic potential of epigenetic inhibitors was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing analysis and its correlation with expression and clinical data in the TCGA dataset were used to identify expression programs normalized by Jumonji lysine demethylase (JmjC) inhibitors. RESULTS: Genetic alterations, aberrant expression, and correlation between tumor expression and poor patient prognosis of epigenetic enzymes are common events in HCC. Epigenetic inhibitors that target bromodomain (JQ-1), lysine methyltransferases (BIX-1294 and LLY-507) and JmjC lysine demethylases (JIB-04, GSK-J4 and SD-70) reduce HCC aggressiveness. The pan-JmjC inhibitor JIB-04 had a potent antitumor effect in tumor bearing mice. HCC cells treated with JmjC inhibitors showed overlapping changes in expression programs related with inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell death. JmjC inhibition reverses an aggressive HCC gene expression program that is also altered in patients with HCC. Several genes downregulated by JmjC inhibitors are highly expressed in tumor vs. non-tumor parenchyma, and their high expression correlates with a poor prognosis. We identified and validated a 4-gene expression prognostic signature consisting of CENPA, KIF20A, PLK1, and NCAPG. CONCLUSIONS: The epigenetic alterations identified in HCC can be used to predict prognosis and to define a subgroup of high-risk patients that would potentially benefit from JmjC inhibitor therapy. LAY SUMMARY: In this study, we found that mutations and changes in expression of epigenetic modifiers are common events in human hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to an aggressive gene expression program and poor clinical prognosis.

However, little is known regarding how pulmonary SC develops and progresses. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old male was initially diagnosed with stage IIIa lung cancer containing both adenocarcinoma (ADC) and SC. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administrated post-surgery, however, recurrence with SC only soon followed. Mutation profiling of the patient's microdissected ADC and SC components of the primary lesion and recurrent tumor was performed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 416 cancer-relevant genes. Our data showed that primary SC/ADC and the recurrent SC shared multiple gene mutations including EGFR, NF1, TP53, CDKN2B, and SMARCA4, while both primary and recurrent SCs had a unique TP53 exon 4 splicing mutation frequently observed in sarcoma. Interestingly, a novel PHF20-NTRK1 fusion was acquired in the recurrent SC, which may be a potential driver for SC recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular genetic characteristics of tumor tissues at different stages reveals a linear tumor evolution model in this case, and support that the primary SC derived from the original lung ADC during the evolution of the tumor.

However, the regulatory molecular mechanism by lncRNA in CRC initiation and progression has not been fully clarified. METHODS: TCGA database was used to identify the involvement of LINC01354 in CRC. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to determine RNA and protein expression. The gain- and loss-of-function assays were conducted to explore the function of LINC01354 in the progression of CRC.

25486933,Strategy for identifying repurposed drugs for the treatment of cerebral cavernous malformation.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a hemorrhagic stroke disease affecting up to 0.5% of North Americans that has no approved nonsurgical treatment. A subset of patients have a hereditary form of the disease due primarily to loss-of-function mutations in KRIT1, CCM2, or PDCD10. We sought to identify known drugs that could be repurposed to treat CCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed an unbiased screening platform based on both cellular and animal models of loss of function of CCM2. Our discovery strategy consisted of 4 steps: an automated immunofluorescence and machine-learning-based primary screen of structural phenotypes in human endothelial cells deficient in CCM2, a secondary screen of functional changes in endothelial stability in these same cells, a rapid in vivo tertiary screen of dermal microvascular leak in mice lacking endothelial Ccm2, and finally a quaternary screen of CCM lesion burden in these same mice. We screened 2100 known drugs and bioactive compounds and identified 2 candidates, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and tempol (a scavenger of superoxide), for further study. Each drug decreased lesion burden in a mouse model of CCM vascular disease by  50%.

30932419,Analysis of LPL gene expression in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"AIM: The IGHV mutational status is one of the most important markers for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) prognostication. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene expression was found to correlate with IGHV status and was suggested as its surrogate marker. Recent data reported that LPL expression might be influenced by pivotal signalling pathways in CLL. This study aimed to assess LPL gene expression in relation to key immunogenetic and molecular markers of CLL, including IGHV mutational status, B-cell receptor (BCR) stereotypy, TP53, NOTCH1, and SF3B1 gene mutations. Materials and Methods: Expression of LPL mRNA was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 73 CLL patients by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). IGHV, NOTCH1, TP53, and SF3B1 gene mutation analysis was performed by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. RESULTS: 44 of 73 (60%) CLL cases were categorized as LPL-positive based on the cut-off value established by ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis. LPL expression was significantly associated with IGHV mutation status (r = 0.684; p < 0.0001) and tended to correlate with presence of NOTCH1 gene mutations (p = 0.113). BCR stereotyped cases showed higher LPL expression values in comparison to unstereotyped cases in the LPL-positive group of patients (p = 0.041).

31681586,Long Non-coding RNAs in Myeloid Malignancies.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents 80% of adult leukemias and 15-20% of childhood leukemias. AML are characterized by the presence of 20% blasts or more in the bone marrow, or defining cytogenetic abnormalities. Laboratory diagnoses of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) depend on morphological changes based on dysplasia in peripheral blood and bone marrow, including peripheral blood smears, bone marrow aspirate smears, and bone marrow biopsies. As leukemic cells are not functional, the patient develops anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, leading to fatigue, recurrent infections, and hemorrhage. The genetic background and associated mutations in AML blasts determine the clinical course of the disease. Over the last decade, non-coding RNAs transcripts that do not codify for proteins but play a role in regulation of functions have been shown to have multiple applications in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic approach of various types of cancers, including myeloid malignancies. After a comprehensive review of current literature, we found reports of multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can differentiate between AML types and how their exogenous modulation can dramatically change the behavior of AML cells. These lncRNAs include: H19, LINC00877, RP11-84C10, CRINDE, RP11848P1.3, ZNF667-AS1, AC111000.4-202, SFMBT2, LINC02082-201, MEG3, AC009495.2, PVT1, HOTTIP, SNHG5, and CCAT1. In addition, by performing an analysis on available AML data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found 10 lncRNAs with significantly differential expression between patients in favorable, intermediate/normal, or poor cytogenetic risk categories. These are: DANCR, PRDM16-DT, SNHG6, OIP5-AS1, SNHG16, JPX, FTX, KCNQ1OT1, TP73-AS1, and GAS5.

31182807,The deubiquitinase Otub1 controls the activation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells by regulating IL-15-mediated priming.,"CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells are central cellular components of immune responses against pathogens and cancer, which rely on interleukin (IL)-15 for homeostasis. Here we show that IL-15 also mediates homeostatic priming of CD8+ T cells for antigen-stimulated activation, which is controlled by a deubiquitinase, Otub1. IL-15 mediates membrane recruitment of Otub1, which inhibits ubiquitin-dependent activation of AKT, a kinase that is pivotal for T cell activation and metabolism. Otub1 deficiency in mice causes aberrant responses of CD8+ T cells to IL-15, rendering naive CD8+ T cells hypersensitive to antigen stimulation characterized by enhanced metabolic reprograming and effector functions. Otub1 also controls the maturation and activation of NK cells. Deletion of Otub1 profoundly enhances anticancer immunity by unleashing the activity of CD8+ T cells and NK cells. These findings suggest that Otub1 controls the activation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells by functioning as a checkpoint of IL-15-mediated priming.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31182807.txt,1,"CD8 T cells and natural killer (NK) cells are central cellular components of immune responses against pathogens and cancer, which rely on interleukin (IL)-15 for homeostasis.

Occasional cases, however, have been reported with cytogenetic anomalies bringing this concept into question. In this study, we used conventional and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction methods to assess the human androgen receptor alpha (HUMARA) gene in 29 female patients with hyaline vascular Castleman disease and compared the results with three cases of plasma cell Castleman disease and 20 cases of age-matched lymphoid hyperplasia. We also assessed for immunoglobulin gene and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, and conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed in three cases of hyaline vascular Castleman disease. In cases with informative results, conventional and methylation-specific human androgen receptor alpha gene analyses yielded a monoclonal pattern in 10 of 19 (53%) and 17 of 23 (74%) cases of hyaline vascular Castleman disease, respectively. A monoclonal pattern was also detected in three cases of plasma cell Castleman disease but not in cases of lymphoid hyperplasia. The frequency of monoclonality was higher for lesions >5 cm in size (100%) and for the stromal-rich variant (91%). Cytogenetic abnormalities in stromal cells were revealed in two cases of hyaline vascular Castleman disease and no cases showed monoclonal immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements.

However, there is limited information regarding the impact of these advances on patient survival in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC who received any treatment in the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (JFCR) between January 1, 1995 and March 1, 2017. A total of 1,547 consecutive patients were included in this case series. In this analysis, five diagnostic periods were evaluated: 1995-1999 (period A), 2000-2004 (period B), 2005-2009 (period C), 2010-2014 (period D), and 2015-2017 (period E). We compared overall survival (OS) between the periods before and after propensity score matching (PSM) and in patients with EGFR mutation, with ALK fusion gene, or without driver mutation. RESULTS: In the past two decades the OS of patients with stage IV NSCLC improved. The median OSs for periods A, B, C, D, and E were 9.0, 11.0, 13.7, 17.9 months, and not reached, respectively. After PSM with known baseline characteristics, the trend of improvement in OS was similar. However, the OS of patients with EGFR mutation or ALK fusion gene did not improve between periods, despite the availability of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Japan. The OS of patients without a driver mutation was slightly longer in the period E.

26485416,Cerebellar Enterogenous Cyst with Atypical Appearance and Pathological Findings.,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial enterogenous cysts are rare and occur mainly in the posterior fossa. These cysts are usually extra-axial, midline, anterior to the brainstem, or at the cerebellopontine angle. Intracranial intra-axial enterogenous cysts are extremely rare. We report a case of an intra-axial cerebellar enterogenous cyst in which diagnosis was difficult because the lesion resembled an arachnoid cyst in appearance and showed atypical pathologic findings. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old woman had a 2-year history of progressive headache, giddiness, and unsteadiness of gait. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic lesion with isointensity to cerebrospinal fluid in the left cerebellar hemisphere, reaching into the fourth ventricle. The patient underwent fenestration of the cyst and creation of a communication between the fourth ventricle and cyst because the tight attachment of the cyst wall to the cerebellum prevented total removal of the cyst. Although pathologic examinations did not show findings typical of enterogenous cyst, the diagnosis was finally made based on the presence of basement membrane and immunohistochemical results. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of enterogenous cyst is based mainly on histologic findings, because characteristic findings on neuroimaging have not been defined. Although total resection of enterogenous cysts is recommended in general, partial resection while ensuring the cyst communicates adequately with the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid space with or without a shunt procedure may be useful if the cyst is adherent to surrounding neurovascular structures.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\26485416.txt,0,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial enterogenous cysts are rare and occur mainly in the posterior fossa.

The mutational status of the c-kit exons 8, 9 and 11, and exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene was analysed to find markers for molecular stratification of MCTs and predictors of clinical outcome. Mutations in the c-kit gene were detected in 19.5% (n = 8/41) samples and their presence was significantly associated with the high histopathological grade (P = 0.038). Mutations in the DNA binding domain of the TP53 gene were found in 14.6% (n = 6/41) of the analysed MCTs, and their frequency was similar in low and high grade MCTs (P > 0.05).

We used time to initiation of ART during primary infection of rhesus macaques (RMs) after intravenous challenge with barcoded SIVmac239 as a means to elucidate the dynamics of RCVR establishment in groups of RMs by creating a multi-log range of pre-ART viral loads and then assessed viral time-to-rebound and reactivation rates resulting from the discontinuation of ART after one year. RMs started on ART on days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 or 12 post-infection showed a nearly 10-fold difference in pre-ART viral measurements for successive ART-initiation timepoints. Only 1 of 8 RMs initiating ART on days 3 and 4 rebounded after ART interruption despite measurable pre-ART plasma viremia.

This study aimed to build a radiomics signature based on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for noninvasive measurement of the MGMT promoter methylation status in glioma. METHODS: One hundred and seven pathology-confirmed primary diffuse glioma patients were retrospectively included and randomly assigned to the primary (n = 71) or validation cohort (n = 36). The MGMT promoter methylation status was measured by pyrosequencing. A total of 1561 radiomics features were extracted from the three-dimensional region of interest (ROI) on the standard uptake value (SUV) maps that were generated from the original 18F-FDG PET data. A radiomics signature, a clinical signature and a fusion signature that combined the clinical and radiomics features together were generated. The performance of the three signatures was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the patient prognosis was stratified based on the MGMT promoter methylation status and the signature with the best performance.

29458761,Methods to Study DNA End Resection I: Recombinant Protein Purification.,"Accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is carried out by homologous recombination. In order to repair DNA breaks by the recombination pathway, the 5'-terminated DNA strand at DSB sites must be first nucleolytically processed to produce 3'-overhang. The process is termed DNA end resection and involves the interplay of several nuclease complexes. DNA end resection commits DSB repair to the recombination pathway including a process termed single-strand annealing, as resected DNA ends are generally nonligatable by the competing nonhomologous end-joining machinery.

DNA end resection commits DSB repair to the recombination pathway including a process termed single-strand annealing, as resected DNA ends are generally nonligatable by the competing nonhomologous end-joining machinery.

31220302,Prognostic Significance of CHEK2 Mutation in Progression of Breast Cancer.,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women; genetic mutations reflect the development of this disease. Mutations in cell signaling factors can be the main cause of BC development. In this study, we focused on mutations in checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) and their impact as a prognostic factor in the pathogenesis of BC. CHEK2 is controlled in cell signaling pathways through the influence of upstream genes. Also, several downstream genes are regulated by CHEK2. In addition, mutations in CHEK2 lead to resistance of BC cells to chemotherapy and metastasis of cancer cells to other parts of the body. Finally, detection of mutations in CHEK2 can be used as a prognostic factor for patient response to treatment and for targeting downstream molecules of CHEK2 that are involved in the proliferation of breast tumor cells.

Patients who have LAM may also be treated with bronchodilators for asthma-like symptoms due to LAM. We observed stabilization of forced expiratory volume in 1 s over time in patients receiving sirolimus and long-acting beta-agonists with short-acting rescue inhalers compared with patients receiving only sirolimus. Because beta-agonists increase cAMP and PKA activity, we investigated effects of PKA activation on the mTOR pathway. Human skin TSC2+/- fibroblasts or LAM lung cells incubated short-term with isoproterenol (beta-agonist) showed a sirolimus-independent increase in phosphorylation of S6, a downstream effector of the mTOR pathway, and increased cell growth. Cells incubated long-term with isoproterenol, which may lead to beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization, did not show increased S6 phosphorylation. Inhibition of PKA blocked the isoproterenol effect on S6 phosphorylation. Thus, activation of PKA by beta-agonists increased phospho-S6 independent of mTOR, an effect abrogated by beta-agonist-driven receptor desensitization.

25924711,High genetic risk individuals benefit less from resistance exercise intervention.,"OBJECTIVES: Genetic factors have an important role in body mass index (BMI) variation, and also likely have a role in the weight loss and body composition response to physical activity/exercise. With the recent identification of BMI-associated genetic variants, it is possible to investigate the interaction of these genetic factors with exercise on body composition outcomes. METHODS: In a block-randomized clinical trial of resistance exercise among women (n=148), we examined whether the putative effect of exercise on weight and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived body composition measurements differs according to genetic risk for obesity. Approximately one-half of the sample was randomized to an intervention consisting of a supervised, intensive, resistance exercise program, lasting 1 year. Genetic risk for obesity was defined as a genetic risk score (GRS) comprised of 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with BMI variation. We examined the interaction of exercise intervention and the GRS on anthropometric and body composition measurements after 1 year of the exercise intervention. RESULTS: We found statistically significant interactions for body weight (P=0.01), body fat (P=0.01), body fat % (P=0.02) and abdominal fat (P=0.02), whereby the putative effect of exercise is greater among those with a lower level of genetic risk for obesity.

The present study aimed to elucidate the frequency of exon 9 and 20 mutations of PIK3CA and their role in disease progression. A total of 118 tumor samples from confirmed breast cancer patients were collected from the histopathology laboratory at King Fahd Hospital of the University (Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia). Sanger sequencing was performed on extracted DNA to identify the mutations on exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA. The results were further validated by competitive allele-specific TaqMan polymerase chain reaction. Three mutations, namely E542K and E545K within exon 9, and H1047R within exon 20, were observed in 25 patients (21.2%). Among these, 18 patients carried the H1047R mutation of the kinase domain, while the remaining 7 patients carried mutations in the helical domain. PIK3CA mutations were associated with the estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive (ER+/PR+) group of tumors in contrast to the ER-/PR- group (P=0.021).

25441388,Differentiating skin-limited and multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify features associated with multisystem involvement and therapeutic failure in patients with skin Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed medical records of 71 consecutive patients with LCH with skin involvement evaluated at Texas Children's Hospital and analyzed clinical features, laboratory results, and the presence of circulating cells with the BRAF-V600E mutation with respect to initial staging and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Skin disease in patients older than 18 months of age at diagnosis was associated with the presence of multisystem disease (OR, 9.65; 95% CI, 1.17-79.4). Forty percent of patients referred for presumed skin-limited LCH had underlying multisystem involvement, one-half of these with risk-organ involvement. Patients with skin-limited LCH had a 3-year progression-free survival of 89% after initial therapy, and none developed multisystem disease. Patients with skin/multisystem involvement had a 3-year progression-free survival of 44% with vinblastine/prednisone therapy, and risk-organ involvement did not correlate with failure to achieve nonactive disease. Circulating cells with BRAF-V600E were detected at higher frequency in patients with multisystem involvement (8 of 11 skin/multisystem vs 1 of 13 skin-limited; P = .002). CONCLUSION: Skin-limited LCH necessitates infrequent therapeutic intervention and has a lower risk of progression relative to skin plus multisystem LCH. The less-aggressive clinical course and lack of circulating cells with the BRAF-V600E mutation in skin-limited LCH suggest a different mechanism of disease origin compared with multisystem or risk-organ disease.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25441388.txt,0,"OBJECTIVE: To identify features associated with multisystem involvement and therapeutic failure in patients with skin Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).

Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A) is a tumor-suppressor in PDAC, but its role in gemcitabine chemoresistance of PDAC has not been clarified. METHODS: The function of HNF1A in gemcitabine was detected by overexpression and knockdown of HNF1A in vitro and in vitro. The regulatory network between HNF1A and ABCB1 was further demonstrated by luciferase assays, deletion/mutation reporter construct assays and CHIP assays. FINDINGS: Here, we found that HNF1A expression is significantly associated with gemcitabine sensitivity in PDAC cell lines. Moreover, we identified that HNF1A overexpression enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity of PDAC both in vitro and in vitro, while inhibition of HNF1A had the opposite effect. Furthermore, by inhibiting and overexpressing HNF1A, we revealed that HNF1A regulates the expression of MDR genes (ABCB1 and ABCC1) in PDAC cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that HNF1A regulates ABCB1 expression through binding to its specific promoter region and suppressing its transcription levels. Finally, the survival analyses revealed the clinical value of HNF1A in stratification of gemcitabine sensitive pancreatic cancer patients. INTERPRETATION: Our study paved the road for finding novel treatment combinations using conventional cytotoxic agents with functional restoration of the HNF1A protein, individualized treatment through HNF1A staining and improvement of the prognosis of PDAC patients.

For these reasons, a better understanding of TNBC biology is required and the development of novel therapeutic approaches are critically needed. Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) is a reported tumor suppressor that is expressed in approximately 20% of primary TNBC tumors, where it is associated with favorable prognostic features and patient outcomes. Previous studies have shown that ERβ mediates the assembly of co-repressor complexes on DNA to inhibit the expression of multiple growth promoting genes and to suppress the ability of oncogenic transcription factors to drive cancer progression. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which ERβ elicits its anti-cancer effects, we developed MDA-MB-231 cells that inducibly express a mutant form of ERβ incapable of directly binding DNA. We demonstrate that disruption of ERβ's direct interaction with DNA abolishes its ability to regulate the expression of well characterized immediate response genes and renders it unable to suppress TNBC cell proliferation. Loss of DNA binding also diminishes the ability of ERβ to suppress oncogenic NFκB signaling even though it still physically associates with NFκB and other critical co-factors. These findings enhance our understanding of how ERβ functions in this disease and provide a model system that can be utilized to further investigate the mechanistic processes by which ERβ elicits its anti-cancer effects.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\36926316.txt,1,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive sub-type of the disease which accounts for a disproportionately high percentage of breast cancer morbidities and mortalities.

Herein, an ultrasensitive Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) biosensor was developed for exosome detection, which was based on 2D MoS2-Fe3O4 nanostructures (MOFE) as magnetic responsive probes for signal amplification. The MOFE can be readily synthesized with simple phase transfer method. Compared to pure Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), the layered MoS2 function as a template for recruiting high loading density of MNPs as magnetic probes. After modified by aptamer, we discover that the 2D magnetic MOFE hybrid nanostructures enable both multidentate targeting and multi-magnetic particle-based signal amplification, increasing the magnetic sensor performance, especially in sensitivity and output signal. Moreover, the 2D magnetic nanocomposites afford high selectivity and excellent reproducibility with detection limit of 100 exosomes in GMR sensor.

The original tumor data was downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas and genotype-tissue expression databases. The expression of LRP11 in normal tissues, tumor tissues and adjacent tissues were evaluated. In addition, we also explored the genetic alteration, prognostic value, and gene function of LRP11. We deeply assessed the interaction between LRP11 and tumor immunity at the pan-cancer level. Finally, research on the association between LRP11 and the resistance of anti-tumor drugs was carried out.
LRP11 was highly expressed and played a risk prognostic factor in cervical cancer and a variety of tumors. Enrichment analysis revealed that LRP11 was involved in multiple tumor malignant pathways. Our research also pointed out the unique role between LRP11 and tumor immune microenvironment. The tumor immune microenvironment of patients with high expression of LRP11 are lack of most immune cells, indicating a immune desert tumor microenvironment. The final drug resistant analysis suggested that patients with high expression of LRP11 may be related to the resistance of many anti-tumor drugs.

METHODS: The karyotypes of 515 AML patients were analyzed by using short-term culture of bone marrow cells and R-banding technique. Combined with FAB typing and genetic testing, cytogenetic changes and prognosis of different age groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The abnormal cloning rate was 54.6% among the 515 patients. The abnormal cloning rate and adverse risk karyotype proportion of those with myeloproliferative syndromes (MDS) and secondary AML were higher than those with de novo AML (P = 0.027; P<0.01). A significant difference was found in the number of structural abnormalities and proportion of favorable risk karyotypes among different age groups (P = 0.026; P = 0.004). And there was also a significant difference in the abnormal cloning rate between different FAB types (P<0.01). In those with non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the expression level of WT1 gene seemed to affect the prognosis.

Consequently, using pan-cancer research to explore the significance of PTOV1 is valuable, and may reveal novel targets for cancer treatment.
A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of PTOV1 was performed. The qRT-PCR was utilized to confirm the aberrant PTOV1 expression in several cancer cell lines.
We observed that PTOV1 mRNA expression was high in 18 cancer tissues and was thereafter associated with poor survival prognosis in a range of malignancies. The immune subtypes of 14 malignancies and the molecular subtypes of six malignancies were related to PTOV1. A substantial association between PTOV1 and immune checkpoint (ICP) genes was also observed. Tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and DNA methylation analyses indicated that PTOV1 acts as a cancer-promoting agent in a series of tumors. In addition, an enrichment study of PTOV1 and related genes revealed that RNA splicing may be responsible for the involvement of PTOV1 in cancers. Lastly, we also verified that PTOV1 expression was elevated in bladder cancer, breast cancer, CESC, LIHC cell lines via qRT-PCR.
Our bioinformatics research indicated that PTOV1 may be involved in tumor immunity.

26152315,Large maculopapular cutaneous lesions are associated with favorable outcome in childhood-onset mastocytosis.,"BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis, characterized by pathologic accumulation of mast cells, can manifest itself in adulthood or childhood. Pediatric patients usually have cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) with mast cell infiltrates limited to the skin and spontaneous improvement of skin lesions after several years. However, there are some patients with persistent disease resembling adulthood-onset mastocytosis. OBJECTIVE: The current classification of CM differentiates between 3 subforms. In clinical practice we noticed that different variants of these subforms might exist, particularly in patients with childhood-onset mastocytosis. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate whether specific cutaneous lesions in patients with childhood-onset mastocytosis are associated with other disease parameters. METHODS: We analyzed 144 patients with a disease onset of less than age 17 years using a systematic dermatologic approach. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two patients presented with maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM), 12 patients presented with diffuse CM, and 10 patients presented with solitary mastocytoma of the skin. Patients with MPCM showed particularly heterogeneous cutaneous lesions and were therefore grouped into 3 variants presenting either with small lesions (MPCM-small, skin lesions <1 cm in diameter; n = 19), large lesions (MPCM-large, skin lesions >= 1 cm in diameter; n = 89), or atypical lesions (MPCM-other, n = 14). Patients with MPCM-large lesions, compared with those with MPCM-small lesions, were characterized by significantly lower tryptase levels, shorter disease duration, and earlier disease onset. In addition, more patients with MPCM-large lesions exhibited spontaneous regression of cutaneous lesions.

30953094,The expression of circulating miR-504 in plasma is associated with EGFR mutation status in non-small-cell lung carcinoma patients.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, are grossly misregulated in some human cancers, including non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The aberrant expression of specific miRNAs results in the abnormal regulation of key components of signalling pathways in tumour cells. MiRNA levels and the activity of the gene targets, including oncogenes and tumour suppressors, produce feedback that changes miRNA expression levels and indicates the cell's genetic activity. In this study, we measured the expression of five circulating miRNAs (miR-195, miR-504, miR-122, miR-10b and miR-21) and evaluated their association with EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR (EGFR) mutation status in 66 NSCLC patients. Moreover, we examined the discriminative power of circulating miRNAs for EGFR mutant-positive and -negative NSCLC patients using two different data normalisation approaches. We extracted total RNA from the plasma of 66 non-squamous NSCLC patients (31 of whom had tumours with EGFR mutations) and measured circulating miRNA levels using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The miRNA expression levels were normalised using two endogenous controls: miR-191 and miR-16. We found significant associations between the expression of circulating miR-504 and EGFR-activating mutations in NSCLC patients regardless of the normalisation approach used (p = 0.0072 and 0.0236 for miR-16 and miR-191 normalisation, respectively).

36928600,Characterization of pancreatic cancer with ultra-low tumor mutational burden.,"In pancreatic cancer (PC), Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has been reported to be lower than in other cancers, with its clinical significance remaining unclear. We analyzed the dataset of whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling of 93 resected PC cases. The median TMB was 0.24. The TMB was classified as High (≥ 5.0), Low (< 5.0, ≥ 1.0), or Ultra-low (< 1.0). Nineteen samples (20%) were classified as TMB-low, and 74 (80%) were classified as TMB-ultra-low; no samples were TMB-high. TMB-ultra-low PC had significantly fewer borderline resectable lesions (P = 0.028) and fewer adenosquamous carcinomas (P = 0.003) than TBM-low PC. Furthermore, the TMB-ultra-low PC showed significantly lower detection rates of driver mutations and copy number variations. Microsatellite instability was not significantly correlated with the TMB status. The TMB-ultra-low PC had a significantly better prognosis than TBM-low PC (P = 0.023).

The cause is usually genetic and various genes are implicated. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we describe a 46,XY woman who was first diagnosed with androgen insensitivity syndrome (testicular feminisation) at 18 years; however, this was later questioned due to the presence of intact Mullerian structures. The clinical phenotype suggested several susceptibility genes including SRY, DHH, NR5A1, NR0B1, AR, AMH, and AMHR2. To study candidate genes simultaneously, we performed whole genome sequencing. This revealed a novel and likely pathogenic missense variant (p.Arg130Pro, c.389G>C) in SRY, one of the major genes implicated in complete gonadal dysgenesis, hence securing this condition over androgen insensitivity syndrome as the cause of the patient's disorder of sexual development.

28298420,Staged induction of HIV-1 glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies.,"A preventive HIV-1 vaccine should induce HIV-1-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). However, bnAbs generally require high levels of somatic hypermutation (SHM) to acquire breadth, and current vaccine strategies have not been successful in inducing bnAbs. Because bnAbs directed against a glycosylated site adjacent to the third variable loop (V3) of the HIV-1 envelope protein require limited SHM, the V3-glycan epitope is an attractive vaccine target. By studying the cooperation among multiple V3-glycan B cell lineages and their coevolution with autologous virus throughout 5 years of infection, we identify key events in the ontogeny of a V3-glycan bnAb. Two autologous neutralizing antibody lineages selected for virus escape mutations and consequently allowed initiation and affinity maturation of a V3-glycan bnAb lineage. The nucleotide substitution required to initiate the bnAb lineage occurred at a low-probability site for activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity. Cooperation of B cell lineages and an improbable mutation critical for bnAb activity defined the necessary events leading to breadth in this V3-glycan bnAb lineage. These findings may, in part, explain why initiation of V3-glycan bnAbs is rare, and suggest an immunization strategy for inducing similar V3-glycan bnAbs.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\28298420.txt,0,"A preventive HIV-1 vaccine should induce HIV-1-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs).

While mRNA translation accounts for the majority of cellular energy expenditure, it is unclear if RNA silencing regulates energy homeostasis. Here, we report that hepatic Argonaute 2 (Ago2)-mediated RNA silencing regulates both intrinsic energy production and consumption and disturbs energy metabolism in the pathogenesis of obesity. Ago2 regulates expression of specific miRNAs including miR-802, miR-103/107, and miR-148a/152, causing metabolic disruption, while simultaneously suppressing the expression of genes regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, including Hnf1beta, Cav1, and Ampka1. Liver-specific Ago2-deletion enhances mitochondrial oxidation and ATP consumption associated with mRNA translation, which results in AMPK activation, and improves obesity-associated pathophysiology. Notably, hepatic Ago2-deficiency improves glucose metabolism in conditions of insulin receptor antagonist treatment, high-fat diet challenge, and hepatic AMPKalpha1-deletion.

36841040,The potential of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway inhibitors in ovarian cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway plays a role in ovarian carcinogenesis. Low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC) frequently harbors activating MAPK mutations. MAPK inhibitors have been used in small subsets of ovarian carcinoma (OC) patients to control tumor growth. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of MAPK inhibitors in OC patients. We aimed to determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR), the subgroup of MAPK inhibitors with the best CBR and overall response rate (ORR), and the most common adverse events.
We conducted a search in PubMed, Embase via Ovid, the Cochrane library and clinicaltrials.gov on studies evaluating the efficacy of single MAPK pathway inhibition with MAPK pathway inhibitors in OC patients. Our primary outcome included the CBR, defined by the proportion of patients with stable disease (SD), complete (CR) and partial response (PR).

We sought to explore the efficacy of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab in Black men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressing after abiraterone or enzalutamide.
This pilot phase II study enrolled self-identified Black patients who developed mCRPC on next-generation hormonal therapies (NHTs) abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide (NCT03770455). Enrolled patients received avelumab 10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks while remaining on the same NHTs. The primary endpoint of our study was ≥ 50% reduction in prostate specific antigen (PSA) at ≥8 weeks.
A total of eight patients were enrolled. The median duration on NHTs prior to enrollment was 364 days (95% CI, 260.9-467.1). The median time to initiate avelumab was 8 days (3-14).

27346689,Large-Scale Exome-wide Association Analysis Identifies Loci for White Blood Cell Traits and Pleiotropy with Immune-Mediated Diseases.,"White blood cells play diverse roles in innate and adaptive immunity. Genetic association analyses of phenotypic variation in circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts from large samples of otherwise healthy individuals can provide insights into genes and biologic pathways involved in production, differentiation, or clearance of particular WBC lineages (myeloid, lymphoid) and also potentially inform the genetic basis of autoimmune, allergic, and blood diseases. We performed an exome array-based meta-analysis of total WBC and subtype counts (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils) in a multi-ancestry discovery and replication sample of ~157,622 individuals from 25 studies. We identified 16 common variants (8 of which were coding variants) associated with one or more WBC traits, the majority of which are pleiotropically associated with autoimmune diseases.

OBSERVATIONS: An eighteen-year-old man with no past medical history was found to have multiple lesions in both eyes that were consistent with FAP-associated CHRPE. Although family history was negative for colon cancer, a colonoscopy was performed, and hundreds of polyps were found extending from the rectum to the distal colon with pathological findings of tubular adenoma. Genetic testing was consistent with a possible de novo Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) mutation. CONCLUSIONS: FAP is an autosomal dominant syndrome that causes colorectal cancer by age thirty-five in ninety-five percent of cases. There has been no established relationship between the benign variants of CHRPE and FAP, and patients with benign variants have no increased risk of colon cancer. While the lack of distinction in nomenclature and similar lesion appearance often leads to misdiagnosis and overtreatment, there are distinct ocular exam features that can provide the correct diagnosis. The exam findings that distinguish FAP-associated CHRPE lesions are (1) bilateralism, (2) occurrence in multiple quadrants, (3) pisiform shape, and (4) irregular borders.

We report here that activated HSCs induce upregulation of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), which is known to regulate multiple metabolic pathways in hepatoma cells of the liver. High levels of NNMT in HCC tissues were positively correlated with vascular invasion, increased serum HBV-DNA levels, and distant metastasis. In addition, functional assays showed that NNMT promoted HCC cell invasion and metastasis by altering the histone H3 methylation on 27 methylation pattern and transcriptionally activating cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44). NNMT-mediated N6-methyladenosine modification of CD44 mRNA resulted in the formation of a CD44v3 splice variant, while its product 1-methyl-nicotinamide stabilized CD44 protein by preventing ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

We performed a chemical screen to identify suppressors of the wanderlust phenotype and found that inhibition of insulin/PI3Kgamma/mTOR signaling rescues the defect. In normal physiology, Bace2 cleaves the insulin receptor, whereas its loss results in hyperactive insulin/PI3K/mTOR signaling.

31239713,Androgen upregulates the palmitoylation of eIF3L in human prostate LNCaP cells.,"Background: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. Most patients diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer can be treated with the main treatment: androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis plays a pivotal role in the progression of prostate cancer. However, most patients can ultimately progress to the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stage within 2 years. At this stage, drugs targeting the AR signaling axis, including enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate, cannot prevent the progression of prostate cancer, thus predicting a poor prognosis. The molecular mechanism lies in the aberrant AR reactivation, which exhibits an adaptive response to ADT, such as the presence of AR splice variants. Thus, CRPC treatment remains a challenge. Purpose: In addition to the AR axis, a mechanism leading to this progression should be determined. The present study mainly compared palmitoylated proteins between androgen-treated LNCaP cells and non-treated LNCaP cells by palmitoylome profiling, to illustrate the changes at proteomic levels. Materials and methods: To screen the androgen-induced palmitoylated proteins, we conducted proteomic experiments using clickable palmitate probe (Alk-C16) between three individual pairs of androgen-treated and non-treated LNCaP cells. Results: We identified 4351 unique peptides corresponding to 835 proteins, among them a number of these identified proteins were palmitoylated proteins, particularly eIF3L. Androgen treatment significantly increased the palmitoylation level of eIF3L, an individual subunit of eIF3. As an initiation factor, eIF3L plays a pivotal role in the translation of mRNAs encoding growth-promoting proteins by enhancing translation rates, thus controlling cell proliferation. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated that the regulation of eIF3L palmitoylation may provide new directions for the therapy of prostate cancer.

31148183,A Noncoding Regulatory RNAs Network Driven by Circ-CDYL Acts Specifically in the Early Stages Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the fastest-rising causes of cancer-related death worldwide, but its deficiency of specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the early stages lead to severe inadequacy in the early diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Covalently closed circular RNA (circRNA), which was once considered an aberrant splicing by-product, is now drawing new interest in cancer research because of its remarkable functionality. Beneath the surface of the dominant functional proteins events, a hidden circRNA-centric noncoding regulatory RNAs network active in the very early stage of HCC is here revealed by a genome-wide analysis of mRNA, circRNA, and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles. Circ-CDYL (chromodomain Y like) is specifically up-regulated in the early stages of HCC and therefore contributes to the properties of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM)-positive liver tumor-initiating cells. Circ-CDYL interacts with mRNAs encoding hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor asparagine hydroxylase (HIF1AN) by acting as the sponge of miR-892a and miR-328-3p, respectively. Subsequently, activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT serine/threonine kinase-mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1/beta-catenin and NOTCH2 pathways, which promote the expression of the effect proteins, baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5 or SURVIVIN) and MYC proto-oncogene, is influenced by circ-CDYL. A treatment incorporating circ-CDYL interference and traditional enzyme inhibitors targeting PI3K and HIF1AN demonstrated highly effective inhibition of stem-like characteristics and tumor growth in HCC. Finally, we demonstrated that circ-CDYL expression or which combined with HDGF and HIF1AN are both independent markers for discrimination of early stages of HCC with the odds ratios of 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.17) and 124.58 (95% CI, 13.26-1170.56), respectively.

However, pre-clinical trials assessing CD28SAbs for the therapy of autoimmune diseases reveal severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome in humans, thereby implying the existence of distinct signalling abilities between human and mouse CD28. Here, we show that a single amino acid variant within the C-terminal proline-rich motif of human and mouse CD28 (P212 in human vs. A210 in mouse) regulates CD28-induced NF-kappaB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. Moreover, this Y209APP212 sequence in humans is crucial for the association of CD28 with the Nck adaptor protein for actin cytoskeleton reorganisation events necessary for CD28 autonomous signalling.

30778901,Disruption of Spermatogenesis and Infertility in Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia Type 2 (AOA2).,"Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) is a rare autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia characterized by onset between 10 and 20 years of age and a range of neurological features that include progressive cerebellar atrophy, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, oculomotor apraxia in a majority of patients, and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). AOA2 is caused by mutation of the SETX gene which encodes senataxin, a DNA/RNA helicase involved in transcription regulation, RNA processing, and DNA maintenance. Disruption of senataxin in rodents led to defective spermatogenesis and sterility in males uncovering a key role for senataxin in male germ cell survival. Here, we report the first clinical and cellular evidence of impaired spermatogenesis in AOA2 patients. We assessed sperm production in three AOA2 patients and testicular pathology in one patient and compared the findings to those of Setx-knockout mice. Sperm production was impaired in all patients assessed (3/3, 100%). Analyses of testicular biopsies from an AOA2 patient recapitulate features of the histology seen in Setx-knockout mice, strongly suggesting an underlying mechanism centering on DNA-damage-mediated germ cell apoptosis. These findings support a role for senataxin in human reproductive function and highlight a novel clinical feature of AOA2 that extends the extra-neurological roles of senataxin. This raises an important reproductive counseling issue for clinicians, and fertility specialists should be aware of SETX mutations as a possible diagnosis in young male patients presenting with oligospermia or azoospermia since infertility may presage the later onset of neurological manifestations in some individuals.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\30778901.txt,0,"Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) is a rare autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia characterized by onset between 10 and 20 years of age and a range of neurological features that include progressive cerebellar atrophy, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, oculomotor apraxia in a majority of patients, and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).

31428516,High-throughput assessment of the antibody profile in ovarian cancer ascitic fluids.,"The identification of effective biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatments remains a challenge in ovarian cancer (OC) research. Here, we present an unbiased high-throughput approach to profile ascitic fluid autoantibodies in order to obtain a tumor-specific antigen signature in OC. We first reported the reactivity of immunoglobulins (Igs) purified from OC patient ascites towards two different OC cell lines. Using a discovery set of Igs, we selected tumor-specific antigens from a phage display cDNA library. After biopanning, 700 proteins were expressed as fusion protein and used in protein array to enable large-scale immunoscreening with independent sets of cancer and noncancerous control. Finally, the selected antigens were validated by ELISA. The initial screening identified eight antigenic clones: CREB3, MRPL46, EXOSC10, BCOR, HMGN2, HIP1R, OLFM4, and KIAA1755. These antigens were all validated by ELISA in a study involving ascitic Igs from 153 patients (69 with OC, 34 with other cancers and 50 without cancer), with CREB3 showing the highest sensitivity (86.95%) and specificity (98%). Notably, we were able to identify an association between the tumor-associated (TA) antibody response and the response to a first-line tumor treatment (platinum-based chemotherapy). A stronger association was found by combining three antigens (BCOR, CREB3, and MRLP46) as a single antibody signature.

31032226,A Novel Approach to Preoperative Risk Stratification in Endometrial Cancer: The Added Value of Immunohistochemical Markers.,"Background: The current model used to preoperatively stratify endometrial cancer (EC) patients into low- and high-risk groups is based on histotype, grade, and imaging method and is not optimal. Our study aims to prove whether a new model incorporating immunohistochemical markers, L1CAM, ER, PR, p53, obtained from preoperative biopsy could help refine stratification and thus the choice of adequate surgical extent and appropriate adjuvant treatment. Materials and Methods: The following data were prospectively collected from patients operated for EC from January 2016 through August 2018: age, pre- and post-operative histology, grade, lymphovascular space invasion, L1CAM, ER, PR, p53, imaging parameters obtained from ultrasound, CT chest/abdomen, final FIGO stage, and current decision model (based on histology, grade, imaging method). Results: In total, 132 patients were enrolled. The current model revealed 48% sensitivity and 89% specificity for high-risk group determination. In myometrial invasion >50%, lower levels of ER (p = 0.024), PR (0.048), and higher levels of L1CAM (p = 0.001) were observed; in cervical involvement a higher expression of L1CAM (p = 0.001), lower PR (p = 0.014); in tumors with positive LVSI, higher L1CAM (p = 0.014); in cases with positive LN, lower expression of ER/PR (p < 0.001), higher L1CAM (p = 0.002) and frequent mutation of p53 (p = 0.008). Cut-offs for determination of high-risk tumors were established: ER <78% (p = 0.001), PR <88% (p = 0.008), and L1CAM >=4% (p < 0.001). The positive predictive values (PPV) for ER, PR, and L1CAM were 87% (60.8-96.5%), 63% (52.1-72.8%), 83% (70.5-90.8%); the negative predictive values (NPV) for each marker were as follows: 59% (54.5-63.4%), 65% (55.6-74.0%), and 77% (67.3-84.2%).

31561847,[Identification and management of patients with Lynch syndrome].,"About 5% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases occurred in the context of an underlying hereditary predisposition syndrome. Lynch syndrome is the main causes of hereditary CRC but is also associated with a higher risk of other cancers (such as endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer). It is the consequence of constitutional mutation in a MisMatch Repair (MMR) gene, involved in DNA repair: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2; or of the EPCAM gene (MSH2 promotor). If a mutation predisposing to Lynch Syndrome is identified in an individual, special monitoring should be initiated, adapted to estimated cancer risk. Clinical criteria (Amsterdam II and Bethesda) have been validated to identify the patients who should be referred for genetic counseling in order to initiate constitutional DNA testing. Furthermore, the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) systematically recommend tumoral testing looking for MMR system failure in case of CRC diagnosed under 60, endometrial cancer diagnosed under 50 or whatever the age in patients diagnosed with CRC or endometrial cancer harbouring personal or familal history of Lunch Syndrome cancers.

31137165,[Differences in circRNA expression profiles between HER-2-positive breast cancer cells and normal mammary epithelial cells].,"Objective: To investigate the differential expression profiles of circular RNA (circRNA) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positive breast cancer cells and normal mammary epithelial cells, and to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic markers for HER-2 positive breast cancer. Methods: Total RNA were extracted from HER-2 positive breast cancer cell SK-BR-3 and normal mammary epithelial cell MCF10A. RNA quality was detected using NanoDrop ND-1000. Rnase R was applied to remove linear RNA and enrich circRNAs. After amplification and reverse transcription into fluorescent complementary RNA (cRNA) using random primer, the labeled cRNAs were hybridized onto the Arraystar Human circRNA Arrays. The raw data were extracted and the acquired array images were subjected to quantile normalization followed by heat map and volcano plot analysis. The expression of circRNAs with large fold change was verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed in the differentially expressed circRNAs and circRNA-microRNA (miRNA) network was constructed. Results: The total RNA extracted from SK-BR-3 and MCF10A had high integrity and quality. The expression profiles of circRNA in SK-BR-3 and MCF10A cells were significantly different shown by fluorescent expression signals. Compared with MCF10A cells, there were 6 584 up-regulated circRNAs and 6254 down-regulated circRNAs in SK-BR-3 cells. There were 348 circRNAs with  log(2)FC >=2, of which 153 were up-regulated and 195 were down-regulated. Moreover, 8 circRNAs with  log(2)FC >5.

31203817,Exome sequencing in routine diagnostics: a generic test for 254 patients with primary immunodeficiencies.,"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) is complex and cumbersome yet important for the clinical management of the disease. Exome sequencing may provide a genetic diagnosis in a significant number of patients in a single genetic test. METHODS: In May 2013, we implemented exome sequencing in routine diagnostics for patients suffering from PIDs. This study reports the clinical utility and diagnostic yield for a heterogeneous group of 254 consecutively referred PID patients from 249 families. For the majority of patients, the clinical diagnosis was based on clinical criteria including rare and/or unusual severe bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, sometimes accompanied by autoimmune manifestations. Functional immune defects were interpreted in the context of aberrant immune cell populations, aberrant antibody levels, or combinations of these factors. RESULTS: For 62 patients (24%), exome sequencing identified pathogenic variants in well-established PID genes. An exome-wide analysis diagnosed 10 additional patients (4%), providing diagnoses for 72 patients (28%) from 68 families altogether. The genetic diagnosis directly indicated novel treatment options for 25 patients that received a diagnosis (34%). CONCLUSION: Exome sequencing as a first-tier test for PIDs granted a diagnosis for 28% of patients. Importantly, molecularly defined diagnoses indicated altered therapeutic options in 34% of cases.

37909662,SMURF1 controls the PPP3/calcineurin complex and TFEB at a regulatory node for lysosomal biogenesis.,"Macroautophagy/autophagy is a homeostatic process in response to multiple signaling, such as the lysosome-dependent recycling process of cellular components. Starvation-induced MTOR inactivation and PPP3/calcineurin activation were shown to promote the nuclear translocation of TFEB. However, the mechanisms via which signals from endomembrane damage are transmitted to activate PPP3/calcineurin and orchestrate autophagic responses remain unknown. This study aimed to show that autophagy regulator SMURF1 controlled TFEB nuclear import for transcriptional activation of the lysosomal biogenesis. We showed that blocking SMURF1 affected lysosomal biogenesis in response to lysosomal damage by preventing TFEB nuclear translocation. It revealed galectins recognized endolysosomal damage, and led to recruitment of SMURF1 and the PPP3/calcineurin apparatus on lysosomes. SMURF1 interacts with both LGALS3 and PPP3CB to form the LGALS3-SMURF1-PPP3/calcineurin complex. Importantly, this complex further stabilizes TFEB, thereby activating TFEB for lysosomal biogenesis. We determined that LLOMe-mediated TFEB nuclear import is dependent on SMURF1 under the condition of MTORC1 inhibition. In addition, SMURF1 is required for PPP3/calcineurin activity as a positive regulator of TFEB. SMURF1 controlled the phosphatase activity of the PPP3CB by promoting the dissociation of its autoinhibitory domain (AID) from its catalytic domain (CD). Overexpression of SMURF1 showed similar effects as the constitutive activation of PPP3CB. Thus, SMURF1, which bridges environmental stress with the core autophagosomal and autolysosomal machinery, interacted with endomembrane sensor LGALS3 and phosphatase PPP3CB to control TFEB activation.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ATG: autophagy-related; LLOMe: L-Leucyl-L-Leucine methyl ester; ML-SA1: mucolipin synthetic agonist 1; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; PPP3CB: protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit beta; RPS6KB1/p70S6K: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; SMURF1: SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\37909662.txt,0,"Macroautophagyautophagy is a homeostatic process in response to multiple signaling, such as the lysosome-dependent recycling process of cellular components.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to explore the effects of zoledronic acid on the healing process in osteoporotic patients following spinal fusion in a randomized, placebo-controlled, and triple-blinded study. METHODS: Seventy-nine osteoporotic patients with single-level degenerative spondylolisthesis were randomly assigned to receive either zoledronic acid infusion (zoledronic acid group) or saline infusion (controls) after spinal fusion. Functional radiography and CT scans were used to evaluate fusion status. Bone formation was graded into three categories: Grade A (bridging bone bonding with adjacent vertebral bodies), Grade B (bridging bone bonding with either superior or inferior vertebral body), or Grade C (incomplete bony bridging). A solid fusion was defined as less than 5  of angular motion with Grade A or B bone formation. Adjacent vertebral compression fractures (VCF) were assessed on MRI at 12 months after surgery. Serum level of carboxy terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) and amino-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) was measured. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by DXA. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used to assess the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Grade A or B bridging bone was more frequently observed in zoledronic acid group at 3, 6, and 9 months post-operation compared to the control group (p < 0.05). At 12 -months post-operation, bridging bone and solid fusion were not significantly different between groups. No patients in zoledronic acid group showed aVCF, whereas six patients (17 %) in the control group did (p < 0.05). Both beta-CTX and PINP were suppressed in zoledronic acid group.

30933052,Detection of a Circulating MicroRNA Custom Panel in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.,"There is increasing interest in liquid biopsy for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic monitoring, creating the need for reliable and useful biomarkers for clinical practice. Here, we present a protocol to extract, reverse transcribe and evaluate the expression levels of circulating miRNAs from plasma samples of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs of 18-25 nucleotides in length that regulate the expression of target genes at the translational level and play an important role, including that of pro- and anti-angiogenic function, in the physiopathology of various organs. miRNAs are stable in biological fluids such as serum and plasma, which renders them ideal circulating biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment decision-making and monitoring. Circulating miRNA extraction was performed using a rapid and effective method that involves both organic and column-based methodologies. For miRNA retrotranscription, we used a multi-step procedure that considers polyadenylation at 3' and the ligation of an adapter at 5' of the mature miRNAs, followed by random miRNA pre-amplification. We selected a 24-miRNA custom panel to be tested by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and spotted the miRNA probes on array custom plates.

29557343,Chemotherapy-Related Cardiac Dysfunction: A Systematic Review of Genetic Variants Modulating Individual Risk.,"Chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction is a significant side effect of anticancer treatment. Risk stratification is based on clinical- and treatment-related risk factors that do not adequately explain individual susceptibility. The addition of genetic variants may improve risk assessment. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase, to identify studies investigating genetic risk factors for chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction. Included were articles describing genetic variants in humans altering susceptibility to chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction. The validity of identified studies was assessed by 10 criteria, including assessment of population stratification, statistical methodology, and replication of findings. We identified 40 studies: 34 exploring genetic risk factors for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (n=9678) and 6 studies related to trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity (n=642).

Included were articles describing genetic variants in humans altering susceptibility to chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction. The validity of identified studies was assessed by 10 criteria, including assessment of population stratification, statistical methodology, and replication of findings.

However, the prevalence of other tumors of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL) spectrum, the clinical outcomes and the potential tumor occurrence in relatives carrying this distinct TP53 mutation were not fully investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated tumor profile data and outcomes of individuals and their close relatives with the TP53 p.R337H germline mutation. A questionnaire and the Toronto protocol were used for evaluation of asymptomatic carriers of this TP53 mutation. RESULTS: The cohort of this study comprised 51 patients from 46 different families; 67% were female. All but one harbored the TP53 p.R337H mutation in heterozygous state; only one child was homozygous for this variant. Maternal allele inheritance occurred in 72% of the cases (p= 0,002). In pediatric group, ACT was the most common primary tumor at the diagnosis (55%; median age= 2 years). No patient of the pediatric group who initially presented with ACT developed a second primary tumor and 11% (n= 3) died due to complications related to the primary tumor (median follow-up time of 81.5 months, range= 3-378 months). In adult group, the main tumors at diagnosis were: adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) (23%; median age= 29.5 years), breast cancer (12%; median age= 38.5 years), soft tissue sarcoma (8%; median age= 50.3 years) and choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) (2%; median age= 18 years). Among adult patients who were diagnosed with ACC as the first primary tumor, all presented with aggressive disease as per histologic and clinical criteria at diagnosis, and 75% of patients died (median follow-up time of 19 months, range= 1-69 months). Five adult patients (22%) had a second primary tumor, including bronchoalveolar lung cancer (2 cases), ACC, uterine cervical carcinoma and fibrosarcoma. The diagnosis of these tumors was established from 8 to 36 months after the first primary tumor. Three families presented more than one case of ACT. Nine malignant neoplasms were diagnosed in asymptomatic carriers using Toronto protocol. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a high frequency of TP53 p.R337H mutation in pediatric group with ACT. In addition, we observed the occurrence of other tumors of LFS/LFL spectrum and a difference in the aggressiveness of ACTs depending on the age group in which they were diagnosed.

B-cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1) has also been implicated with CRC. However, the association between miR-27a-3p and BTG1 in CRC, to the best of our knowledge, has not been investigated. In order to assess whether miR-27a-3p is associated with CRC, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed on 20 paired CRC and paracancerous tissues for miRNA analysis. For the screening and validation of miR-27a-3p expression in colon cancer, several colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116, HCT8, SW480, HT29, LOVO and Caco2) and the normal colorectal epithelial cell line NCM460 were examined. The highest expression levels of miR-27a-3p were detected in the HCT-116, which was selected for further experimentation. The HCT-116 cells were divided into control, miR-27a-3p mimic and inhibitor groups, and cell proliferation was tested using an MTT assay. Additionally, miR-27a-3p inhibitor/mimic or BTG1 plasmid were transfected into the HCT-116 cells, and flow cytometry was performed to analyze cell cycle distributions. TUNEL analysis was performed to detect apoptosis. Protein levels of factors in the downstream signaling pathway mediated by miR-27a-3p [ERK/mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)] were detected. miR-27a-3p was revealed to be overexpressed in human CRC tissues and colon cancer cell lines.

Among others, known as wild type GIST, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient tumors develop due to genetic or epigenetic alterations in any of four SDH genes. Herein, we present a unique case of SDH-deficient GIST with an unusual heterogeneous SDHA and SDHB staining pattern and mutations detected in the SDHA and KIT gene. A 50-year-old patient presented with a 5 cm large gastric tumor with a multinodular/plexiform growth pattern, mixed epithelioid and spindle cell morphology, and focal pronounced nuclear atypia with hyperchromasia and high mitotic activity. Immunohistochemically, CD117 and DOG-1 were positive. SDHB and SDHA stains showed loss of expression in some of the nodules, whereas others presented with an unusually weak patchy positivity. Molecular analysis revealed a point mutation in exon 5 of the SDHA gene and a mutation in exon 11 of the KIT gene. We hypothesize that based on the allele frequency of SDHA and KIT mutations the tumor is best regarded as SDH-deficient GIST in which the SDHA mutation represents the most likely driver mutation. The identified KIT mutation raises the distinct possibility that the KIT mutation is a secondary event reflecting clonal evolution.

26706013,Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of widespread hamartomatous lesions in various organs, including brain, skin, kidneys, heart, and eyes. Central nervous system is almost invariably involved, with up to 85% of patients presenting with epilepsy, and at least half of patients having intellectual disability or other neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder. TSC is caused by the mutation in one of the 2 genes TSC1, at 9q34, and TSC2, at 16p13.3. They respectively encode for hamartin and tuberin, which form an intracellular complex inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin. Mammalian target of rapamycin overactivation following the genetic defect determines the cell growth and proliferation responsible for TSC-related lesions, as well as the alterations in neuronal excitability and synaptogenesis leading to epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders. A causative mutation for the disorder is identified in about 85% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of TSC. Mosaicism and technology limits likely explain most of the no mutation identified cases. This review confirms that patients with TSC2 mutations considered as a group usually present a more severe phenotype, characterized by higher number of tubers, earlier age at seizure onset and higher prevalence of intellectual disability. However, the clinical phenotype of the disease presents a high variability, thus making the prediction of the phenotype on an individual basis still challenging. The increasing application of new molecular techniques to subjects with TSC has the potential to significantly reduce the rate of patients with no mutation demonstrated and to identify an increasing higher number of mutations. This would hopefully allow a better characterization of higher risk mutations, which might help clinicians to plan individualized surveillance plans.

We aimed to study this population to determine if a CRC-specific gene panel increased the yield of testing. METHODS: Patients with CRC <= 35 evaluated from 05/2014-11/2017 were identified from the genetic counseling database. Records were reviewed for personal/family history and genetic counseling outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred forty-three patients with CRC <= 35 were included. One hundred four (72.7%) underwent CRC panel testing. Thirty-nine (27.2%) had syndrome-directed testing, declined, or were lost to follow-up. Forty-two patients had a genetic syndrome (29.4%). Twenty-four of the 42 hereditary patients (57.1%) were identified via syndrome-directed testing. Mutations identified via panel testing were consistent with patient personal/family history. Thirty-three patients had at least one variant of uncertain significance. CONCLUSION: Hereditary syndromes were identified in 29.4% of patients. Panel testing in patients without a phenotype did not increase diagnostic yield, but identified variants in one-third. Disease-specific panel testing is of low yield in young patients without a suggestive personal/family history.

This results in PKAc-mediated phosphorylation of compartmentalized substrates that control central aspects of cell physiology. The mechanism of PKAc activation and signaling have been largely characterized. However, the modes of PKAc inactivation by regulated proteolysis were unknown. Here, we identify a regulatory mechanism that precisely tunes PKAc stability and downstream signaling. Following agonist stimulation, the recruitment of the chaperone-bound E3 ligase CHIP promotes ubiquitylation and proteolysis of PKAc, thus attenuating cAMP signaling. Genetic inactivation of CHIP or pharmacological inhibition of HSP70 enhances PKAc signaling and sustains hippocampal long-term potentiation. Interestingly, primary fibroblasts from autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 16 (SCAR16) patients carrying germline inactivating mutations of CHIP show a dramatic dysregulation of PKA signaling.

Three polysaccharides were shown to have the same chemical structure of beta-(1,3)-glucan with beta-(1,6) branches, and exhibited S-180 tumor-suppressing ability with good safety. It was found that beta-glucans up-regulated CD4+ T cell level in lymphoid organs decreased by tumor-burden, indicating promotion of immunomodulation. beta-glucans targeted tumors in vivo even after oral or intraperitoneal injection. Furthermore, beta-glucans not only targeted to lymphoid organs and increased CD4+ T cells number, but also enhanced CD4+ T cells and neutrophils populations in tumors.

Reporting five children of one extended family with hemizygous mutations in IL2RG, we explore potential diagnostic clues and extend our comprehension of the functional impact of this mutation. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES); detailed immune phenotyping; cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation; B, T, and NK cell activation; and quantification of sjTRECs in five Arab children with c.664C>T (p.R222C) IL2RG mutation. RESULTS: The mean age at clinical presentation with respiratory tract infection or diarrhea was 6.8 (range: 2-12) months. None of the children presented with opportunistic infections. Diagnostic clues were early onset in the first year of life, and a suggestive family history associated with reduced naive CD4 T cells and absent switched memory B cells. Number and phenotype of NK cells and innate-like lymphocytes were normal. The diagnosis was made by WES and corroborated by absent STAT phosphorylation and reduced functional response after IL-2 and IL-21 stimulation. Four patients underwent successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: As early diagnosis and treatment are important, a high index of suspicion in the diagnosis of c.664C>T (p.R222C) X-SCID is needed.

Here, we aimed to develop a test for assessing MLH1 promoter methylation based in next generation sequencing (NGS), and to evaluate the concordance of MLH1 methylation and BRAF-V600 mutation status in CRC. For that, we performed a series of experiments with DNA from tumor, saliva and commercial control samples and our in house developed amplicon-based NGS test.

Concordance rates between tissue and plasma/peritoneal ctDNA mutation detection can vary, but is generally high. ctDNA has a potential role in monitoring anti-EGFR treatment response and resistance, as well as in predicting future prognosis and recurrence. The detection of ctDNA in plasma of patients with isolated PM is also possibly suggestive of occult systemic disease, and patients exhibiting such ctDNA positivity may benefit from systemic treatment.

The primary objective is to compare progression-free survival (per RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review of patients with progressive, advanced, multikinase inhibitor-naive, RET-mutant MTC treated with selpercatinib versus cabozantinib or vandetanib. Key secondary objectives are to compare other efficacy outcomes (per RECIST 1.1) and tolerability of selpercatinib versus cabozantinib or vandetanib.",['cancer'],1

The best approach to their management is not yet established. This case outlines the management of a splenic cyst in a 21-month-old boy following severe IMD. The case took place in the context of an acute emergence of serogroup W prompting significant media attention and subsequent change in vaccination practice at a jurisdictional level in Australia. The patient was critically unwell early in the illness, then later a collection in the left upper quadrant was detected, shown on ultrasound to be a 11.6x7.7 cm splenic cyst. In this case, the cyst was managed by ultrasound-guided drainage tube insertion. The residual collection was small and stable on subsequent imaging.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\29728436.txt,0,"Splenic complications of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are well recognised, though cyst formation is rare, particularly in paediatric populations.

31372940,Clinical Implications of Chromosomal Instability (CIN) and Kinetochore Abnormalities in Breast Cancers.,"Genetic instability is a defining property of cancer cells and is the basis of various lesions including point mutations, copy number alterations and translocations. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is part of the genetic instability of cancer and consists of copy number alterations in whole or parts of cancer cell chromosomes. CIN is observed in differing degrees in most cancers. In breast cancer, CIN is commonly part of the genomic landscape of the disease and has a higher incidence in aggressive sub-types. Tumor suppressors that are commonly mutated or disabled in cancer, such as p53 and pRB, play roles in protection against CIN, and as a result, their dysfunction contributes to the establishment or tolerance of CIN. Several structural and regulatory proteins of the centromeres and kinetochore, the complex structure that is responsible for the correct distribution of genetic material in the daughter cells during mitosis, are direct or, mostly, indirect transcription targets of p53 and pRB. Thus, despite the absence of structural defects in genes encoding for centromere and kinetochore components, dysfunction of these tumor suppressors may have profound implications for the correct function of the mitotic apparatus contributing to CIN.

In this context, we analyzed diagnostic samples from 121 patients affected by MN and ten relapse samples from a subset of acute myeloid leukemia patients using two enrichment-capture NGS gene panels. Pathogenicity classification of variants was enhanced by the development and application of a custom onco-hematology score. A total of 278 pathogenic variants were detected in 84% of patients. For structural alterations, 82% of those identified by cytogenetics were detected by NGS, 25 of 31 copy number variants and three out of three translocations. The detection of variants using NGS changed the diagnosis of seven patients and the prognosis of 15 patients and enabled us to identify 44 suitable candidates for clinical trials. Regarding AML, six of the ten relapsed patients lost or gained variants, comparing with diagnostic samples.

We ascertained 19 individuals from 15 families with likely pathogenic or pathogenic PHF6 variants (11 males and 8 females). One family had previously been reported. Six variants were novel. We analysed the clinical and genetic findings in our series and compared them with reported BFLS patients. Affected males had classic features of BFLS including intellectual disability, distinctive facies, large ears, gynaecomastia, hypogonadism and truncal obesity. Carrier female relatives of affected males were unaffected or had only mild symptoms. The phenotype of affected females with de novo variants overlapped with the males but included linear skin hyperpigmentation and a higher frequency of dental, retinal and cortical brain anomalies. Complications observed in our series included keloid scarring, digital fibromas, absent vaginal orifice, neuropathy, umbilical hernias, and talipes. Our analysis highlighted sex-specific differences in PHF6 variant types and locations. Affected males often have missense variants or small in-frame deletions while affected females tend to have truncating variants or large deletions/duplications.

31312279,Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer: A Review of the Current Trend in Africa.,"Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and the 11th most common cancer in woman accounting for 6.6% of all cancer cases. Approximately 70-75% bladder cancers are non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). A few African studies have provided considerable rates of NMIBC as compared to western settings 70% to 85%. Critical step in the management of NMIBC is to prevent tumor recurrence which include transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) for staging and histological diagnosis. A second TURBT for high grade tumor, T1 tumors and intravesical adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy are essential to reduce recurrence rate. Nevertheless, variant histology, multiple, progressive and recurrent high-grade tumors are best treated with early radical cystectomy. The African literature is scanty on the management of NMIBC. Most of the histological types are squamous cell bladder cancer and may not conform to transurethral resection only but rather radical cystectomy. Most of these patients are not suitable for any form of treatment as they present with advanced disease. However, there is an increasing incidence of urothelial cancer in Africa over the years due to urbanization.

This study examined the relationship between the extent of increase in urinary excretion of 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha and N-methyl histamine, with serum tryptase, whole blood serotonin, and bone marrow findings including morphology, percentage involvement, and abnormal mast cell phenotype. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 90 patients who were continuously enrolled in the study for a period of 6 years (2008-2014). We recorded serum tryptase, whole blood serotonin, levels of urinary mast cell metabolites 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha and N-methyl histamine (NMH), and bone marrow findings. RESULTS: Urinary mast cell metabolites 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha and N-methyl histamine correlated with levels of serum tryptase, mast cell burden in the bone marrow, the presence of mast cell aggregates, and atypical mast cells on bone marrow biopsy. Whole blood serotonin did not have a significant correlation with the serum tryptase or mast cell burden in the bone marrow.

31571071,Optimized immunohistochemical detection of estrogen receptor beta using two validated monoclonal antibodies confirms its expression in normal and malignant breast tissues.,"PURPOSE: Significant controversy exists regarding the expression patterns of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) in normal and diseased breast tissue. To address this issue, we have validated two ERbeta antibodies, optimized the IHC protocols for both antibodies and now report the expression patterns of ERbeta in normal and malignant breast tissues. METHODS: ERbeta antibody specificity was determined using western blot and IHC analysis. ERbeta protein expression patterns were assessed via IHC in normal breast tissue and invasive breast carcinoma. Further, we report the detailed protocol of the ERbeta IHC assay developed in our CAP/CLIA certified laboratory to provide a standardized method for future studies. RESULTS: We have confirmed the specificity of two independent ERbeta monoclonal antibodies, one that detects total (i.e., full length plus splice variants 2-5, which do not include the ligand binding domain) ERbeta protein (PPZ0506) and one that detects only the full-length form, which includes the ligand binding domain, of ERbeta (PPG5/10). Using these two antibodies, we demonstrate that ERbeta is highly expressed in normal human breast tissue as well as in 20-30% of invasive breast cancers. Further, these two antibodies exhibited similar staining patterns across multiple different tissues and were highly concordant with regard to determining ERbeta positivity in breast cancers. CONCLUSIONS: ERbeta protein was shown to be abundant in the majority of normal breast epithelial cells and is present in 20-30% of breast cancers. Use of these two antibodies, along with their standardized IHC protocols, provide a reference for future studies aimed at determining the utility of ERbeta as a prognostic and/or predictive biomarker in various tissues of benign or malignant states.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31571071.txt,1,"PURPOSE: Significant controversy exists regarding the expression patterns of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) in normal and diseased breast tissue.

26537623,Remission and platelet responses with romiplostim in primary immune thrombocytopenia: final results from a phase 2 study.,"In anecdotal reports, some patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) maintained platelet counts after discontinuing romiplostim. Here, we examined rates of platelet response (>=50 x 10(9) /l), remission, splenectomy and adverse events in patients with primary ITP duration <=6 months who were treated with romiplostim for <=12 months. The starting dose of romiplostim was 1 mug/kg; concomitant and rescue treatments were permitted to maintain platelet counts. Patients with platelet counts >=50 x 10(9) /l at the end of 12 months entered a dose taper in which the romiplostim dose was decreased as long as platelet counts were maintained. Remission (platelet count >=50 x 10(9) /l for 24 consecutive weeks with no ITP treatments) was evaluated in patients once romiplostim was discontinued. Over the 12 months, a high response rate (>90%) was observed. Platelet response occurred quickly (median, ~2 weeks) and was observed for a cumulative median of 11 months.

23656349,A clinical and genetic overview of 18 years neurofibromatosis type 1 molecular diagnostics in the Netherlands.,"NF1 mutations are the underlying cause of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a neuro-cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (NCFC). Because of the clinical overlap between NCFCs, genetic analysis of NF1 is necessary to confirm a clinical diagnosis NF1. This report describes the clinical and genetic findings of 18 years of NF1 molecular diagnostics in the Netherlands. A pathogenic mutation was found in 59.3% (1178/1985) of the index patients, mostly de novo (73.8%). The majority of the index patients (64.3%) fulfilled the National Institute of Health NF1 criteria, a pathogenic mutation was found in 80.9% of these patients. Seventy-four percent of the index patients with an NF1 pathogenic mutation and not fulfilling the NF1 criteria is <12 years, in agreement with the fact that some NF1 symptoms appear after puberty. Genotype-phenotype correlations were studied for 527 index patients. NF1 patients with a type 1 microdeletion have a sixfold higher risk of special education vs NF1 patients with an intragenic mutation. No evidently milder NF1 phenotype for patients with a missense mutation was observed. Forty-six prenatal analyses were performed in 28 (2.4%) families, of which 29 (63%) showed heterozygosity for the familial pathogenic mutation.

31650704,Comparative aspects of mast cell neoplasia in animals and the role of KIT in prognosis and treatment.,"Mast cell neoplasia clinical presentation and biological behaviour vary considerably across mammalian species, ranging from a solitary benign mass to an aggressive systemic malignancy. Mutations in the KIT Proto-Oncogene Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (KIT) gene are common molecular abnormalities involved in mast cell tumorigenesis. KIT mutations often occur in dog, cat and human neoplastic mast cells and result in altered Kit protein structure and function. In dogs, certain KIT mutations are associated with more malignant and lethal disease. In contrast, KIT mutations in feline and human mast cell neoplasms are not correlated with prognosis, but are of value in diagnosis and treatment planning in humans. KIT genetic abnormalities have not been well investigated in other species, although aberrant cytoplasmic Kit protein staining detected in neoplasms of the ferret, horse and cow resembles aberrant Kit staining patterns detected in neoplastic mast cells of dogs, cats and humans. Mutations within KIT are classified as either regulatory-type or enzymatic pocket-type mutations according to their location within the KIT Proto-Oncogene. Mutations within the enzymatic pocket domain confer tumour resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, knowledge of tumour KIT mutation status adds valuable information for optimizing patient treatment strategies. The use of TKIs in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics has opened a new treatment avenue for patients unresponsive to existing drugs.

31355228,Prognostic significance of the PANK family expression in acute myeloid leukemia.,"BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogenous hematological malignancy and its prognostication depends on the genetic mutation and expression profile of each patient. Pantothenate kinase (PANK) is a regulatory enzyme that controls coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. It has four isoforms encoded by PANK1-4, respectively. Whether the expression of the PANK family has prognostic significance in AML remains unclear. METHODS: We screened The Cancer Genome Atlas database for AML patients with complete PANK1-4 expression data. Eighty-four AML patients met the criteria and were included in this study. Clinical characteristics at diagnosis, including peripheral blood (PB) white blood cell counts (WBC), blast percentages in PB and bone marrow (BM), French-American-British (FAB) subtypes and the frequencies of common genetic mutations were described. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were constructed for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), using a limited backward elimination procedure. RESULTS: Patients with high PANK2 expression had significantly longer event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with low PANK2 expression (P=0.007, P=0.016, respectively), whereas patients with high PANK4 expression had shorter EFS and OS than patients with low PANK4 expression (P=0.022, P=0.015, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed that high PANK4 expression was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS (both P<0.05).

23318425,DMAP1 is an essential regulator of ATM activity and function.,"The hereditary autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is caused by mutation in the DNA damage kinase ATM. ATM's main function is to orchestrate DNA repair, thereby maintaining genomic stability. ATM activity is increased in response to several stimuli, including ionising radiation (IR) and hypotonic stress. DNMT1-associated protein 1 (DMAP1) is a member of the TIP60-p400 histone acetyl transferase (HAT) complex, which acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16) to affect chromatin relaxation and modulate ATM activation. Here we demonstrate that DMAP1 is required for both modes of ATM activation. Knockdown of DMAP1 impaired IR-induced ATM activation and consequently resulted in radiosensitivity and impaired the G2/M checkpoint. Moreover, DMAP1 was also required for efficient ATM signalling in response to hypotonic stress. Overexpression of DMAP1 increased IR-induced ATM substrate phosphorylation, suggesting that DMAP1 function is rate limiting for ATM signalling. DMAP1 associated with TIP60-dependent HAT activity, and depletion of DMAP1 reduced H4K16 acetylation in response to DNA damage. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors rescued IR-induced ATM signalling in Dmap1-depleted cells.

PFBC is a heterogeneous disorder currently linked to variants in six different genes, but most patients remain genetically undiagnosed. Here, we identify biallelic NAA60 variants in ten individuals from seven families with autosomal recessive PFBC. The NAA60 variants lead to loss-of-function with lack of protein N-terminal (Nt)-acetylation activity. We show that the phosphate importer SLC20A2 is a substrate of NAA60 in vitro. In cells, loss of NAA60 caused reduced surface levels of SLC20A2 and a reduction in extracellular phosphate uptake.

25923088,Porphobilinogen deaminase gene mutations in Polish patients with non-erythroid acute intermittent porphyria.,"BACKGROUND: Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an metabolic disorder characterized by a partial deficiency of the porphobilinogen deaminase, the enzyme of heme biosynthesis. The metabolic defect in AIP involves an approximately half-normal activity of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD, EC 4.3.1.8), the enzyme catalyzing condensation of four porphobilinogen molecules to hydroxymethylbilane. Due to tissue-specific alternative transcript splicing, the PBGD gene mutations within the range of exons 3-15 may lead to classical AIP involving erythrocytes and all the other tissues. Mutations within intron and exon 1 may result in the so-called non-erythroid AIP in which the PBGD activity is normal in erythrocytes and diminished in other tissues. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to characterise molecular errors in the PBGD gene in Polish patients with non-erythroid AIP and to evaluate the efficacy of the DNA sequencing method in the early diagnosis of this disorder. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty five members of nine non-erythroid AIP families were assessed. In each of them DNA sequencing was performed using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v.1.1 on the Hitachi 3730 Analyzer (Applied Biosystem, USA). RESULTS: Four mutations were detected in intron 1 of the PBGD gene, including one unreported novel mutation, 33+(4-12) del AGTGCTGAG, of an unknown biological mechanism, and three previously described mutations, i.e. 33+1 G > A, 33+2 T > C, 33+5 G > C, responsible for abnormal transcript splicing in the area of exon 1.

Most patients with LDS develop severe aortic aneurysms resulting in early need of surgical intervention. In order to gain further insight into the pathophysiology of the disorder, we investigated circulating outgrowth endothelial cells (OEC) from the peripheral blood of LDS patients from a cohort of 23 patients including 6 patients with novel TGF-beta receptor mutations. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed gene expression profiling of OECs using microarray analysis followed by quantitative PCR for verification of gene expression. Compared to OECs of age- and sex-matched healthy controls, OECs isolated from three LDS patients displayed altered expression of several genes belonging to the TGF-beta pathway, especially those affecting bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling including BMP2, BMP4 and BMPR1A. Gene expression of BMP antagonist Gremlin-1 (GREM1) showed the most prominent up-regulation. This increase was confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting of LDS-OECs. In immunohistochemistry, abundant Gremlin-1 protein expression could be verified in endothelial cells as well as smooth muscle cells within the arterial media.

It is debated whether this is related to the much more common clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma, owing to the substantial similarity of their immunohistochemical phenotypes. The term renal angiomyoadenomatous tumour has been used by some authors in this context, but this is a source of controversy with some believing it is synonymous with clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma.

Other uncommon patterns of renal neoplasms, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma with degenerative fibrosis or haemangioma-like changes, mixed epithelial and stromal tumour with epithelial proliferation, angiomyolipoma with epithelial cysts, renal cell carcinoma with associated angiomyolipoma, and sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma may cause diagnostic challenges for the pathologist. Although knowledge of renal cell carcinomas with a stromal component has dramatically increased recently, further study is necessary to understand the molecular pathology of these tumours and if they have implications for inherited tumour syndromes.",['carcinoma'],1

However, the prognostic features including recurrence and histological transformation (HT) remain unknown. We conducted a single-institute retrospective analysis of 464 patients with newly diagnosed MALT lymphoma, evaluating the impact of t(11;18) on clinical outcomes. One hundred and six patients were screened for the translocation by fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Of these patients, 26 patients (25%) were diagnosed as MALT lymphoma with t(11;18). The patients had a significantly shortened progression-free survival (PFS at 10 years; 26% v 57%; P = 0.004) compared to those without t(11;18). However, this did not translate into overall survival or incidence of HT. We confirmed previous reports stating that t(11;18)-positive MALT lymphoma showed disseminated disease and refractoriness to H. pylori eradication therapy.

31371806,Myeloid neoplasms in the setting of sickle cell disease: an intrinsic association with the underlying condition rather than a coincidence; report of 4 cases and review of the literature.,"Myeloid neoplasms occasionally occur in patients with sickle cell disease, and the underlying connection between the two diseases is unclear. Herein, we retrospectively analyzed four cases of sickle cell disease patients who developed myeloid neoplasm. Age at time of diagnosis ranged from 27 to 59 years with a median of 35.5 years. Two patients were treated with hydroxyurea and the other two with supportive care alone, with one out of the four patients receiving additional treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Three patients presented with leukocytosis, and the remaining patient presented with pancytopenia. Two patients were diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm, one with myelodysplastic syndrome, and the other with acute myeloid leukemia. All four cases demonstrated certain degrees of myelodysplasia and complex cytogenetic abnormalities with - 7/7q- and/or - 5/5q- or with 11q23 (KMT2A) rearrangement. This cytogenetic profile resembles that seen in therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, suggesting that myeloid neoplasm in the setting of sickle cell disease may represent a subcategory of the disease distinct from de novo myeloid neoplasm in general. Extensive literature review further demonstrates this similarity in cytogenetic profile, as well as in other associated pathologic features. Potential etiology includes therapy for sickle cell disease, disease-related immunomodulation, or disease-related chronic inflammation. We hypothesize that constant hematopoietic hyperplasia, stimulated by a hemolysis-induced cytokine storm, may increase the chance of somatic mutations/cytogenetic aberrations, resulting in transformation of myeloid precursors.

36380563,The effect of EGFR-TKIs on survival in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations: A real-world study.,"Few large-scale studies have been published using real-world data related to overall survival (OS) improvements in advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung cancer patients; therefore, little is known regarding the characteristics of patients who could benefit most from EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Our study aimed to assess whether EGFR-TKI treatment confers survival benefits among advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR mutations in the Chinese population.
A total of 6451 advanced NSCLC patients were diagnosed between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2019 in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. Ultimately, 2864 patients with a confirmed EGFR mutation genotype were enrolled in our study. OS was measured from the time of diagnosis of advanced NSCLC until death or last follow-up.
Median follow-up for OS of advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients was 28.33 months in our study. Patients who received EGFR-TKIs demonstrated better survival compared to those without EGFR-TKI treatment (mOS: 29.77 vs. 22.97 months, p < 0.0001). A total of 451 patients switched to third-generation EGFR-TKI treatment and obtained a significantly better survival than those who adopted first-line third-generation EGFR-TKIs or those who did not receive third-generation EGFR-TKIs after disease progression with first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI treatment (mOS: 38.0 vs. 32.5 vs. 28.3 months, p < 0.0001).

36789775,Prevalence and Therapeutic Implications of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential in Young Patients With Stroke.,"Undetermined stroke etiology hampers optimal secondary prevention in a large proportion of young patients. We explored whether genetic screening for clonal hematopoiesis of indetermined potential (CHIP), a novel risk factor for stroke, could identify patients with myeloid precursor lesions or covert myeloid neoplasm requiring specific treatment.
We performed targeted sequencing on 56 genes recurrently mutated in hematologic neoplasms in a prospective cohort of patients with acute brain ischemia between 18 and 60 years. CHIP prevalence was compared with age-matched healthy controls from the Nijmegen Biomedical Study (n=1604) and the UK Biobank (n=101 678). Patients with suspicion of high-risk CHIP or myeloid neoplasm were invited for further hematologic evaluation.
We included 248 consecutive patients (39% women) of whom 176 (71%) had cryptogenic stroke etiology. Fifty-one (21%) patients had CHIP, 3-fold more than in the general population (7.7% versus 2.6% for the Nijmegen Biomedical Study and 11.9% versus 4.1% for UK Biobank; <i>P</i><0.001 for both). Patients with CHIP were older (median [interquartile range], 53 [50-59] versus 51 [41-56] years; <i>P</i><0.001), had higher carotid intima-media thickness (0.68 [0.58-0.80] versus 0.59 [0.51-0.73] mm; <i>P</i>=0.009), and had higher burden of atherosclerosis (29.4% versus 16.7%; <i>P</i>=0.04).

30895378,DNA methylation profiling distinguishes Ewing-like sarcoma with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion from Ewing sarcoma.,"PURPOSE: Recent studies revealed divergent gene expression patterns in Ewing sarcoma (EwS) with canonical EWSR1-ETS gene fusions and undifferentiated round cell sarcomas (URCS) with EWSR1 rearrangements fused to the non-ETS gene NFATc2. Thus, the question arises whether the latter tumors really belong to EwS. METHODS: We collected five cases matching the group of URCS with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion and performed DNA methylation and copy number profiling. Results were compared to methylation data of 30 EwS with various EWSR1-ETS fusions and one EwS with FUS-ERG fusion, 16 URCS with CIC rearrangement and 10 URCS with BCOR alteration and a total of 81 EWSR1-associated soft tissue sarcomas including 7 angiomatoid fibrous histiocytomas, 7 clear cell sarcomas of the soft tissue, 28 desmoplastic small round cell tumors, 10 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas and 29 myxoid liposarcomas. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis of DNA methylation data revealed a homogeneous methylation cluster for URCS with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion, which clearly segregated from EwS and the other subtypes.

Risk factors for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were determined using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Of 1460 patients who underwent CLM resection during the study period, 507 met the inclusion criteria. Multigene testing revealed mutation rates greater than 10% for TP53 (mutated in 70.8% of patients), APC (53.5%), RAS (50.7%), PIK3CA (15.8%), and SMAD4 (11.0%). BRAF was mutated in 2.0% of patients.

At the present time, there is only one study suggesting the relationship between AGD and risk of prostate cancer (CaP). The goal of this study was to assess the performance and clinical utility of AGD, as a biomarker of prenatal androgenic milieu, and risk of CaP in a larger population, in CaP diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted on 260 men seen in a hospital outpatient clinic where underwent a physical and andrological examination and completed a brief questionnaire. CaP patients were confirmed by biopsy of the tumor. Controls were men without CaP seen in the urology outpatient clinic for routine examinations. Two variants of AGD (from the anus to the posterior base of the scrotum [AGDAS] and to the cephalad insertion of the penis [AGDAP]) were measured. Parametric and non-parametric tests and receiver operating characteristic (COR) analyses were used to determine relationships between AGD and presence of CaP. RESULTS: The highest area under the curve (0.69; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.78 and 0.69; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.77) was obtained for the Gleason=7 subgroup with the AGDAS and AGDAP measurement, with a sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 55%, and 91% and 41%, the predictive positive value of 39% and 35% and negative value of 90% and 93% respectively.

36801606,The role of tumour biological factors in technical anatomical resectability assessment of colorectal liver metastases following induction systemic treatment: An analysis of the Dutch CAIRO5 trial.,"Large inter-surgeon variability exists in technical anatomical resectability assessment of colorectal cancer liver-only metastases (CRLM) following induction systemic therapy. We evaluated the role of tumour biological factors in predicting resectability and (early) recurrence after surgery for initially unresectable CRLM.
482 patients with initially unresectable CRLM from the phase 3 CAIRO5 trial were selected, with two-monthly resectability assessments by a liver expert panel. If no consensus existed among panel surgeons (i.e. same vote for (un)resectability of CRLM), conclusion was based on majority. The association of tumour biological (sidedness, synchronous CRLM, carcinoembryonic antigen and RAS/BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation status) and technical anatomical factors with consensus among panel surgeons, secondary resectability and early recurrence (<6 months) without curative-intent repeat local treatment was analysed by uni- and pre-specified multivariable logistic regression.
After systemic treatment, 240 (50%) patients received complete local treatment of CRLM of which 75 (31%) patients experienced early recurrence without repeat local treatment. Higher number of CRLM (odds ratio 1.09 [95% confidence interval 1.03-1.15]) and age (odds ratio 1.03 [95% confidence interval 1.00-1.07]) were independently associated with early recurrence without repeat local treatment. In 138 (52%) patients, no consensus among panel surgeons was present prior to local treatment. Postoperative outcomes in patients with and without consensus were comparable.
Almost a third of patients selected by an expert panel for secondary CRLM surgery following induction systemic treatment experience an early recurrence only amenable to palliative treatment.

24718618,Rapid and efficient conversion of integration-free human induced pluripotent stem cells to GMP-grade culture conditions.,"Data suggest that clinical applications of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) will be realized. Nonetheless, clinical applications will require hiPSCs that are free of exogenous DNA and that can be manufactured through Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Optimally, derivation of hiPSCs should be rapid and efficient in order to minimize manipulations, reduce potential for accumulation of mutations and minimize financial costs. Previous studies reported the use of modified synthetic mRNAs to reprogram fibroblasts to a pluripotent state. Here, we provide an optimized, fully chemically defined and feeder-free protocol for the derivation of hiPSCs using synthetic mRNAs. The protocol results in derivation of fully reprogrammed hiPSC lines from adult dermal fibroblasts in less than two weeks. The hiPSC lines were successfully tested for their identity, purity, stability and safety at a GMP facility and cryopreserved.

In this pilot study, we compare L-methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS for their ability to predict glioma subtypes. METHODS: Nineteen patients with histologically, confirmed newly diagnosed glioma underwent preoperative L-methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS in 1 diagnostic session. According to the molecular portfolio and histopathologic diagnosis, patients were subdivided in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma, IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma, IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion, and with 1p/19q codeletion subgroups. Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio (TBRmax), creatine, choline, and N-acetyl aspartate peaks were correlated with postoperative histopathologic tumor diagnoses. RESULTS: Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio was highest in glioblastoma patients (4.18) followed by patients with IDH wild-type grade II and III glioma (3.41). The latter TBRmax values were higher compared with those in patients with IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion (1.95) and in patients with IDH-mutant 1p/19q codeleted grade II and III glioma (2.79). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy marker distribution showed no clear trend. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed TBRmax to be the best performing parameter in identifying IDH status (area under the curve, 0.67) and all spectroscopy markers combined in identifying glioma subgroups (area under the curve, 0.68), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: L-Methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS bear limited potential in glioma subgrouping.

Bone involvement although frequent has not been thoroughly evaluated. Primary objective was to determine risk factors associated with fragility fractures (FF) in SM. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the ability of bone marrow tryptase (BMT) level to identify patients with FF, and to describe bone involvement in SM. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively all consecutive patients seen in our expert center, with a diagnosis of SM according to the 2001 WHO criteria, and with complete bone assessment. We collected data about lifetime fractures, types of cutaneous manifestations, degranulation symptoms, blood and BMT levels, bone mineral density assessed by densitometry and KIT mutation. We performed a univariate analysis investigating the factors associated with FF and then a logistic multivariable regression analysis. We assessed the ability of bone marrow tryptase to identify patients with FF. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients with SM were included. Thirty-six patients (40.4%) suffered from osteoporosis and twenty-five (28.1%) experienced lifetime FF. Univariate analysis identified age at diagnosis and disease onset, presence of telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans, digestive symptoms, mast cells activation symptoms, elevated BMT, low femoral and lumbar BMD, as associated with FF. Multivariate analysis identified elevated BMT, low femoral T score and older age at diagnosis as independently associated with FF.

Several studies have shown that the efficacy of pemetrexed in HER2-mutant NSCLC is controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of pemetrexed combined with platinum chemotherapy in patients with HER2-mutant and HER2 wild-type lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The clinical data of 106 cases of EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, KRAS, BRAF, RET and MET-negative patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients who diagnosed by histopathology in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were retrospectively reviewed. The relationships between HER2 gene status, clinical characteristics and response and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. RESULTS: All of the 106 patients' HER2 status were determined. HER2 mutations occurred in 32 cases (30.2%), no mutations in 74 cases (69.8%). HER2 mutations were common in young, non-smoking and female patients.

In PV group, a significant correlation was observed between miR-125a-5p and platelet counts (P  0.01, r  0.531). The correlation between miRNA and JAk2 allele burden was not significant. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data indicate that other factors such as aberrant miR-125 expression may influence on the disease phenotype in patients with PV and ET.",[],0

25557241,Outcomes of preimplantation genetic diagnosis in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of patient and facility level factors on the success of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Large PGD reference laboratory. PATIENT(S): All patients with NF1 referred from June 2004 to May 2013. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Embryos' NF1 mutation status and live birth rates. RESULT(S): Seventy-seven couples underwent 156 PGD cycles during the study period. The average maternal age at the time of embryo biopsy was 33.2 years. The majority of embryos had a day 3 single blastomere biopsy without aneuploidy screening. A diagnosis was obtained for 80% of biopsied embryos; 20% of biopsies were nondiagnostic due to technical failures. Diagnosis was more often obtained for embryos of parents with familial disease and for embryos biopsied at centers that referred multiple NF1 cases. Among diagnosed embryos, 483/1,060 (46%) were unaffected by the parental NF1 mutation. Twenty-two (14%) of the 156 cycles had a confirmed live birth; if the observed success rate is applied to cycles with unknown outcomes, 33/156 (21%) cycles are expected to have resulted in live birth. In multivariate logistic regression, having a live birth was significantly associated with having more unaffected embryos available for transfer (odds ratio 1.33 per additional embryo, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.72).

Regardless of age of presentation and severity of symptoms related to thrombocytopenia and/or platelet dysfunction, a subset of patients with IT are at increased risk of developing myeloid neoplasms during their life time, particularly those with germline autosomal dominant mutations in RUNX1, ANKRD26, and ETV6. Patients may present with isolated thrombocytopenia and megakaryocytic dysmorphia or atypia on baseline bone marrow evaluation, without constituting myelodysplasia (MDS). Bone marrow features may overlap with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or sporadic MDS leading to misdiagnosis. Progression to myelodysplastic syndrome/ acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) may be accompanied by progressive bi- or pancytopenia, multilineage dysplasia, increased blasts, cytogenetic abnormalities, acquisition of bi-allelic mutations in the underlying gene with germline mutation, or additional somatic mutations in genes associated with myeloid malignancy. A subset of patients may present with MDS/AML at a young age, underscoring the growing concern for evaluating young patients with MDS/AML for germline mutations predisposing to myeloid neoplasm. Early recognition of germline mutation and predisposition to myeloid malignancy permits appropriate treatment, adequate monitoring for disease progression, proper donor selection for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as well as genetic counseling of the affected patients and their family members.

Its imaging and immunohistochemical characteristics may overlap with other renal tumors, which renders its early diagnosis in a dilemma. The diagnosis of primary renal synovial sarcoma requires histopathology and the confirmation of SYT-SSX gene fusion using molecular techniques. Cases of primary renal synovial sarcoma have been previously reported in the literature. However, to our knowledge, primary renal allograft synovial sarcoma was never described. CASE SUMMARY: A 43-year-old male patient who underwent kidney transplantation 9 months ago came to our hospital for regular follow-up. Traditional ultrasonography revealed multiple hypo-echo neoplasms in the renal allograft. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) showed slightly hyper-density masses with slow homogeneous enhancement. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was conducted for accurate pathological diagnosis. The neoplasms were diagnosed as synovial sarcoma by pathological, immunohistochemical, and genetic analyses. Positron emission tomography/CT showed no evidence of metastasis. At approximately one week post biopsy, contrast-enhanced ultrasound was conducted to eliminate active hemorrhage. One month later, CECT showed that the biggest neoplasm grew from 3.3 cm to 5.7 cm in diameter. Parametric imaging was conducted with SonoLiver CAP to conduct further quantitative analysis, which showed that the enhancement pattern was heterogeneous hyper-vascular enhancement. Radical surgical resection of the whole renal allograft and ureter was conducted without additional adjuvant chemotherapy or external radiotherapy. Anlotinib was chosen for targeted therapy with a good response.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Targeted next-generation sequencing with a panel of 18 thyroid carcinoma-related genes was performed on tissue samples from 41 PDTC and 25 ATC patients. Genetic alterations and their correlations with clinicopathological factors, including survival outcomes, were also analysed. Our results showed that ATC had significantly higher mutation rates of BRAF, TP53, TERT and PIK3CA than PDTC (P = 0.005, P = 0.007, P = 0.005, and P = 0.033, respectively). Nine (69%) ATC cases with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) components harboured BRAF mutations, all of which coexisted with a late mutation event (TP53, TERT, or PIK3CA). Nine cases with oncogenic fusion (six RET cases, one NTRK1 case, one ALK case, and one PPARG case) were identified in 41 PDTCs, whereas only one case with oncogenic fusion (NTRK1) was found among 25 ATCs. Moreover, all six cases of RET fusion were found in PDTC with PTC components, accounting for 33%. In PDTC/ATC patients, concurrent TERT and PIK3CA mutations were associated with poor overall survival after adjustment for TNM stage (P = 0.001).

METHODS AND RESULTS: MYC rearrangements assessed in 13 unpublished single-centre PBL cases, and an additional 85 cases from the literature, with reported MYC rearrangement information individualised by patient, were reviewed. In Asia, PBL was much less commonly diagnosed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients (27% versus 84%, P = 0.000), with older age (median age at diagnosis: 52 years versus 44 years, P = 0.046) and a lower EBV infection rate (56.8% versus 81.8%, P = 0.049), than in non-Asian regions. Overall, MYC rearrangements were identified in 44 of 98 (44.9%) PBL cases, and IGH was the partner in almost all available cases (30/31, 96.8%), as confirmed with a MYC-IGH fusion probe. The MYC rearrangement rate in HIV-positive cases (33/55, 60.0%) was significantly higher than that in HIV-negative cases (11/38, 28.9%, P = 0.003). Patients with MYC rearrangement showed a trend towards an inferior median survival time (9.6 months versus 15.7 months, P = 0.122) and 2-year overall survival (17% versus 32%, P = 0.238).

Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA) provide a nonimmunosuppressive option for children who require an increased platelet count. PROCEDURE: We performed a multicenter retrospective study of pediatric ITP patients followed at ITP Consortium of North America (ICON) sites to characterize TPO-RA use. RESULTS: Seventy-nine children had a total of 87 treatments (28 eltrombopag, 43 romiplostim, and eight trialed on both). The majority had primary ITP (82%) and most (60.8%) had chronic ITP. However, 22% had persistent ITP and 18% had newly diagnosed ITP. During the first 3 months of treatment, 89% achieved a platelet count >= 50 x 10(9) /l (86% romiplostim, 81% eltrombopag, P = 0.26) at least once in the absence of rescue therapy. The average time to a response was 6.4 weeks for romiplostim and 7.0 weeks for eltrombopag (P = 0.83). Only 40% of patients demonstrated a stable response with consistent dosing over time.

30918505,Senecavirus A 3C Protease Mediates Host Cell Apoptosis Late in Infection.,"Senecavirus A (SVA), an oncolytic picornavirus used for cancer treatment in humans, has recently emerged as a vesicular disease (VD)-causing agent in swine worldwide. Notably, SVA-induced VD is indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and other high-consequence VDs of pigs. Here we investigated the role of apoptosis on infection and replication of SVA. Given the critical role of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway on modulation of cell death, we first assessed activation of NF-kappaB during SVA infection. Results here show that while early during infection SVA induces activation of NF-kappaB, as evidenced by nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB-p65 and NF-kappaB-mediated transcription, late in infection a cleaved product corresponding to the C-terminus of NF-kappaB-p65 is detected in infected cells, resulting in lower NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. Additionally, we assessed the potential role of SVA 3C protease (3Cpro) in SVA-induced host-cell apoptosis and cleavage of NF-kappaB-p65. Transient expression of SVA 3Cpro was associated with cleavage of NF-kappaB-p65 and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), suggesting its involvement in virus-induced apoptosis. Most importantly, we showed that while cleavage of NF-kappaB-p65 is secondary to caspase activation, the proteolytic activity of SVA 3Cpro is essential for induction of apoptosis. Experiments using the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK confirmed the relevance of late apoptosis for SVA infection, indicating that SVA induces apoptosis, presumably, as a mechanism to facilitate virus release and/or spread from infected cells. Together, these results suggest an important role of apoptosis for SVA infection biology.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\30918505.txt,1,"Senecavirus A (SVA), an oncolytic picornavirus used for cancer treatment in humans, has recently emerged as a vesicular disease (VD)-causing agent in swine worldwide.

We measured the value added by computer-assisted image analysis to the diagnostic yield on a cohort consisting of 679 individuals with 105 different monogenic disorders. For each case in the cohort we compiled frontal photos, clinical features, and the disease-causing variants, and simulated multiple exomes of different ethnic backgrounds. RESULTS: The additional use of similarity scores from computer-assisted analysis of frontal photos improved the top 1 accuracy rate by more than 20-89% and the top 10 accuracy rate by more than 5-99% for the disease-causing gene.

Diagnosis of type 3 VWD was based on undetectable VWF antigen levels in the plasma. Genomic DNA from these patients was screened for mutations in VWF gene. Structural modeling and expression studies were carried out for missense mutations. RESULTS: Out of 102 patients, mutations could be identified in 91% (n = 93). Fifty-five different gene variants were identified. Thirty-four (61.8%) were novel. Mutations could be identified in both the alleles in 90 patients, while no causative mutation could be identified in 9 patients; twenty-four (23.5%) patients had mutations clustered in the propeptide region of VWF.

The median age at diagnosis is 62 years, and an estimated 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lifetime. African American women are more likely to die of breast cancer compared with women of other races. Objective: To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on medications for risk reduction of primary breast cancer. Evidence Review: The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the accuracy of risk assessment methods to identify women who could benefit from risk-reducing medications for breast cancer, as well as evidence on the effectiveness, adverse effects, and subgroup variations of these medications. The USPSTF reviewed evidence from randomized trials, observational studies, and diagnostic accuracy studies of risk stratification models in women without preexisting breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Findings: The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk assessment tools can predict the number of cases of breast cancer expected to develop in a population. However, these risk assessment tools perform modestly at best in discriminating between individual women who will or will not develop breast cancer. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk-reducing medications (tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors) provide at least a moderate benefit in reducing risk for invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer. The USPSTF found that the benefits of taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk for breast cancer are no greater than small in women not at increased risk for the disease. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that tamoxifen and raloxifene and adequate evidence that aromatase inhibitors are associated with small to moderate harms. Overall, the USPSTF determined that the net benefit of taking medications to reduce risk of breast cancer is larger in women who have a greater risk for developing breast cancer.

Here, we sampled a large cohort (n = 52) of canine normal/tumor oral MM from three predisposed breeds (poodles, Labrador retrievers, and golden retrievers), and used deep transcriptome sequencing to identify more than 400 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs. We further prioritized candidate lncRNAs by comparative genomic analysis to pinpoint 26 dog-human conserved DE lncRNAs, including SOX21-AS, ZEB2-AS, and CASC15 lncRNAs. Using unsupervised co-expression network analysis with coding genes, we inferred the potential functions of the DE lncRNAs, suggesting associations with cancer-related genes, cell cycle, and carbohydrate metabolism Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

In other words, heterogeneity within the subgroup of MSI-H tumors remains poorly understood. Thus, an in-depth molecular characterization of MSI-H tumors is urgently required. METHODS: Here, we use nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based consensus clustering to define CRC MSI-H subtypes in The Cancer Genome Atlas and a French multicenter cohort GSE39582. CIBERSORT was used to calculate the proportions of 22 lymphocytes in tumor tissue in MSI-H subtypes. RESULTS: MSI-H CRC samples basically clustered into two subgroups (MSI-H1 and MSI-H2). MSI-H1 was characterized by a lower BRAF mutational status, higher frequency of chromosomal instability, global hypomethylation, and worse survival than MSI-H2. Further examination of the immune landscape showed that macrophages of the M2 phenotype were enriched in MSI-H1, which may be associated with poor prognosis in this subgroup.

RCTs comparing the TPO-RAs with placebo in adult ITP were included. Primary outcomes were the overall response rate. Secondary outcomes included safety, durable response, overall or clinically significant bleeding, and the proportion of patients receiving rescue medication.

Therefore, to provide reliable and comparable results, the standardization of molecular techniques is mandatory.A network of 19 centers was established to 1) evaluate the inter- and intra-laboratory variability in JAK2V617F quantification, 2) identify the most robust assay for the standardization of the molecular test and 3) allow consistent interpretation of individual patient analysis results. The study was conceived in 3 different rounds, in which all centers had to blindly test DNA samples with different JAK2V617F allele burden (AB) using both quantitative and qualitative assays.The positivity of samples with an AB < 1% was not detected by qualitative assays. Conversely, laboratories performing the quantitative approach were able to determine the expected JAK2V617F AB. Quantitative results were reliable across all mutation loads with moderate variability at low AB (0.1 and 1%; CV = 0.46 and 0.77, respectively). Remarkably, all laboratories clearly distinguished between the 0.1 and 1% mutated samples.In conclusion, a qualitative approach is not sensitive enough to detect the JAK2V617F mutation, especially at low AB.

We also inserted into the TRAC locus two chains of a neoantigen-specific TCR (neoTCR) isolated from circulating T cells of patients. The neoTCRs were isolated using a personalized library of soluble predicted neoantigen-HLA capture reagents. Sixteen patients with different refractory solid cancers received up to three distinct neoTCR transgenic cell products. Each product expressed a patient-specific neoTCR and was administered in a cell-dose-escalation, first-in-human phase I clinical trial ( NCT03970382 ). One patient had grade 1 cytokine release syndrome and one patient had grade 3 encephalitis. All participants had the expected side effects from the lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Five patients had stable disease and the other eleven had disease progression as the best response on the therapy. neoTCR transgenic T cells were detected in tumour biopsy samples after infusion at frequencies higher than the native TCRs before infusion. This study demonstrates the feasibility of isolating and cloning multiple TCRs that recognize mutational neoantigens.

Recent studies have suggested that mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin can reverse TSC-associated deficits in rodent models of TSC. In addition, clinical trials are ongoing to test the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors toward the psychiatric symptoms associated with TSC. Here, we report a case study of a Korean patient with TSC, who exhibited multiple symptoms including frequent seizures, intellectual disability, language delays, and social problems. We performed whole exome sequencing and identified a novel small deletion mutation in TSC2. Expressing the novel deletion mutant in HEK293T cells significantly increased mTOR pathway activation. Furthermore, everolimus treatment showed not only reduction in SEGA size, but dramatically improved behavioral deficits including autism related behaviors in the patient.

The extent to which the prognostic impact of MYCN-A depends on other factors has not been fully characterized. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group database, we constructed Cox models of overall survival (OS) to obtain hazard ratios of the effect of MYCN-A within subgroups defined by other prognostic factors. Cox models assessed the degree to which the prognostic impact of MYCN-A was modulated by each other covariate. We used absolute hazard ratio (HR) differences to construct classification trees to identify subgroups with greatest differential prognostic effect of MYCN-A. RESULTS: In a cohort of 6223 patients with known MYCN status, the OS hazard ratio associated with MYCN-A was 6.3 (95% confidence interval 5.7-7.0, P < .001). Age at diagnosis conferred the largest HR absolute difference for MYCN-A between subgroups (HR absolute difference 16.6; HRs for MYCN-A of 19.6 for <18 months, 3.0 for >=18 months). MYCN-A remained significantly prognostic of OS after controlling for other factors, abrogating their prognostic strength. Patients whose outcome was most impacted by MYCN status were those who were <18 months, had high mitosis karrhyohexis index (MKI) and low ferritin. CONCLUSION: The prognostic strength of MYCN-A varies depending on which patient subgroup defined by other neuroblastoma risk factors is examined, with greatest strength in patients with otherwise favorable features.

In this study of 7226 Chinese women with invasive breast cancer, we defined breast cancer subtypes using immunohistochemical (IHC) measures of hormone receptors and HER2 in conjunction with histologic grade. p53 expression status was then used to further stratify subtypes into p53-positive and p53-negative. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in case-only logistic regression analyses were used to examine heterogeneity across different subtypes. The frequency of p53 protein expression varied by breast cancer subtype, being lowest in the luminal A-like and highest in the triple-negative and HER2-enriched subtypes (P-value < 0.01).

30514913,Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency with a focus on newborn screening.,"Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) II deficiency is one of the most common forms of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorder. Its clinical phenotypes are classified into the muscle, severe infantile, and lethal neonatal forms. Among Caucasians, the muscle form predominates, and the c.338C > T (p.S113L) variant is detected in most cases, whereas among the Japanese, c.1148T > A (p.F383Y) is the variant allele occurring with the highest frequency and can apparently cause symptoms of the severe infantile form. Newborn screening (NBS) for this potentially fatal disease has not been established. We encountered an infantile case of CPT II deficiency not detected in NBS using C16 and C18:1 concentrations as indices, and therefore we adopted the (C16 + C18:1)/C2 ratio as an alternative primary index. As a result, the disease was diagnosed in nine of 31 NBS-positive subjects. The values for (C16 + C18:1)/C2 in the affected newborns partly overlapped with those in unaffected ones. Among several other indices proposed previously, C14/C3 has emerged as a more promising index. Based on these findings, nationwide NBS for CPT II deficiency using both (C16 + C18:1)/C2 and C14/C3 as indices was officially approved and started in April 2018. We diagnosed the disease in four young children presenting with symptoms of the muscle form, whose values for the new indices were not elevated.

However, the precise frequency of the mutation, the biological significance of peripheral blood-mutated cells and their potential association with involvement of bone marrow hematopoietic cells other than mast cells still remain to be investigated. Here, we determined the frequency of peripheral blood involvement by the KIT D816V mutation, as assessed by two highly sensitive PCR methods, and investigated its relationship with multilineage involvement of bone marrow hematopoiesis.

RAS-BRAF mutational status and primary tumor location are also important factors for the selection of optimal combinations therapies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the Turkish oncologists' treatment decisions depending on tumor location and mutational status in metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: An online survey link was sent to the medical oncologists who are registered to Turkish Society of Medical Oncology via e-mail and mobile applications. RESULTS: Ninety-four oncologists (85.5%) reported that tumor localization affects their treatment modality. In RAS-BRAF wild type left colon tumors, Turkish oncologists mostly use chemotherapy and anti-EGFR therapy (90.1%) for the first-line treatment, while on the right side, oncologists favored anti-VEGF therapy in combination with chemotherapy (65.5%). BRAF-mutant tumors in left colon had nearly the same rates of treatment tendency with both anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR antibodies in combination with chemotherapy, while in right-sided tumors the main treatment selection of the participants was anti-VEGF-based treatment (83.6%).

31019896,Genetic Profile and Clinical Implications of Hepatoblastoma and Neuroblastoma Coexistence in a Child.,"The aim of the following case report is to provide a description of the coexistence of two independent tumors in a child. A 9-month-old male was referred to Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology with hepatic tumor present on ultrasound imaging and symptoms of enlarged abdominal circumference. Physical examination revealed a palpable epigastric mass and the imaging techniques showed a tumor of the left hepatic lobe measuring 11 x 6.5 x 8.9 cm with pancreas infiltration, distant metastases in both lungs and abnormal lesion in the left adrenal gland. Basing on histopathological examination, after a core-needle biopsy, hepatoblastoma (HBL) (mixed epithelial-mesenchymal subtype) was diagnosed. The alpha-fetoprotein level was 112 993 ng/ml. Elevated values of normetanephrine, 3-methoxytyramine as well as neuron-specific enolase were observed. Due to the clinical picture and diagnosis, the patient was qualified to preoperative chemotherapy according to the SIOPEL-3 protocol, followed by SIOPEL-4 protocol for the high-risk patients. After undergoing preoperative chemotherapy, imaging tests revealed regression of hepatic tumor and no focal pulmonary masses, while regression of adrenal gland mass was not completed. The patient was qualified for left hemihepatectomy with left adrenalectomy. Histopathological examination of liver specimen confirmed the HBL diagnosis. However, in left adrenal gland and paraaortic lymph nodes the residual neuroblastoma (NBL) cells were detected. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was utilized to identify disease-associated germline mutations. WES revealed a novel germline insertion variant in TWIST1 (p.Gly86dup), along with the potentially pathogenic non-synonymous variants in NF1 (p.Val2511Ile), RAF1 (p.Leu445Arg), and WHSC1 (p.Ser4Asn) genes. Currently, 6 months after completion of treatment according to the SIOPEL-4 protocol, the patient is in good general condition, without any signs, and symptoms of relapse of both neoplasms. The coexistence of two different primary childhood malignancies is rarely seen. So far, only one case of synchronous HBL and NBL has been reported. However, for the first time therapeutic process was successful. A specific signature of rare germline mutations can be proposed as a predisposing factor to synchronous HBL and NBL occurrence.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31019896.txt,1,"The aim of the following case report is to provide a description of the coexistence of two independent tumors in a child.

25824806,Clinical and laboratory characterization of 114 cases of Castleman disease patients from a single centre: paraneoplastic pemphigus is an unfavourable prognostic factor.,"This study retrospectively collected the clinical and laboratory data of 114 patients with Castleman disease (CD) from a single medical centre. Clinical classification identified 62 patients (54 4%) with unicentric Castleman disease and 52 (45 6%) with multi-centric Castleman disease. Pathological classification revealed 68 cases (59 6%) of hyaline vascular variant, 16 (14 1%) mixed cellular variant (Mix) and 30 (26 3%) plasmacytic variant. Clinical complications occurred in 69 CD patients, including 37 cases of paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) and 25 cases with renal complications. Haematological involvement, pleural effusion and/or ascites and POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes) were also found. Univariate analysis showed that presence of clinical complications and PNP were both risk factors relating to CD patient survival. Prognostic factors showing P < 0 15 in univariate analysis and those with clinical significance were subjected to multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model. PNP presence and age over 40 years both significantly adversely affected survival. Thus, only presence of PNP was identified as an independent unfavourable survival risk factor in both univariate and multivariate analyses.

31189972,Acid specific dark quencher QC1 pHLIP for multi-spectral optoacoustic diagnoses of breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is the most common type of malignant growth in women. Early detection of breast cancer, as well as the identification of possible metastatic spread poses a significant challenge because of the structural and genetic heterogeneity that occurs during the progression of the disease. Currently, mammographies, biopsies and MRI scans are the standard of care techniques used for breast cancer diagnosis, all of which have their individual shortfalls, especially when it comes to discriminating tumors and benign growths. With this in mind, we have developed a non-invasive optoacoustic imaging strategy that targets the acidic environment of breast cancer. A pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP) was conjugated to the dark quencher QC1, yielding a non-fluorescent sonophore with high extinction coefficient in the near infrared that increases signal as a function of increasing amounts of membrane insertion. In an orthotopic murine breast cancer model, pHLIP-targeted optoacoustic imaging allowed us to differentiate between healthy and breast cancer tissues with high signal/noise ratios. In vivo, the sonophore QC1-pHLIP could detect malignancies at higher contrast than its fluorescent analog ICG-pHLIP, which was developed for fluorescence-guided surgical applications. PHLIP-type optoacoustic imaging agents in clinical settings are attractive due to their ability to target breast cancer and a wide variety of other malignant growths for diagnostic purposes. Intuitively, these agents could also be used for visualization during surgery.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31189972.txt,1,"Breast cancer is the most common type of malignant growth in women.

31406244,FDA-approved drug screen identifies proteasome as a synthetic lethal target in MYC-driven neuroblastoma.,"MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma predicts poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. Yet pharmacological strategies of direct MYC inhibition remain unsuccessful due to its ""undruggable"" protein structure. We herein developed a synthetic lethal screen against MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas using clinically approved therapeutic reagents. We performed a high-throughput screen, from a library of 938 FDA-approved drugs, for candidates that elicit synthetic lethal effects in MYC-driven neuroblastoma cells. The proteasome inhibitors, which are FDA approved for the first-line treatment of multiple myeloma, emerge as top hits to elicit MYC-mediated synthetic lethality. Proteasome inhibition activates the PERK-eIF2alpha-ATF4 axis in MYC-transformed cells and induces BAX-mediated apoptosis through ATF4-dependent NOXA and TRIB3 induction. A combination screen reveals the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat (SAHA) concertedly induce dramatic cell death in part through synergistic activation of BAX. This combination causes marked tumor suppression in vivo, supporting dual proteasome/HDAC inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for MYC-driven cancers. This FDA-approved drug screen with in vivo validation thus provides a rationale for clinical evaluation of bortezomib, alone or in combination with vorinostat, in MYC-driven neuroblastoma patients.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31406244.txt,1,"MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma predicts poor prognosis and resistance to therapy.

28165011,mTORC1-independent TFEB activation via Akt inhibition promotes cellular clearance in neurodegenerative storage diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant accumulation of undigested cellular components represent unmet medical conditions for which the identification of actionable targets is urgently needed. Here we identify a pharmacologically actionable pathway that controls cellular clearance via Akt modulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathways. We show that Akt phosphorylates TFEB at Ser467 and represses TFEB nuclear translocation independently of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a known TFEB inhibitor. The autophagy enhancer trehalose activates TFEB by diminishing Akt activity. Administration of trehalose to a mouse model of Batten disease, a prototypical neurodegenerative disease presenting with intralysosomal storage, enhances clearance of proteolipid aggregates, reduces neuropathology and prolongs survival of diseased mice. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt promotes cellular clearance in cells from patients with a variety of lysosomal diseases, thus suggesting broad applicability of this approach.

27939943,The Mitotic Checkpoint Complex Requires an Evolutionary Conserved Cassette to Bind and Inhibit Active APC/C.,"The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) ensures genomic stability by preventing sister chromatid separation until all chromosomes are attached to the spindle. It catalyzes the production of the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC), which inhibits Cdc20 to inactivate the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). Here we show that two Cdc20-binding motifs in BubR1 of the recently identified ABBA motif class are crucial for the MCC to recognize active APC/C-Cdc20. Mutating these motifs eliminates MCC binding to the APC/C, thereby abolishing the SAC and preventing cells from arresting in response to microtubule poisons. These ABBA motifs flank a KEN box to form a cassette that is highly conserved through evolution, both in the arrangement and spacing of the ABBA-KEN-ABBA motifs, and association with the amino-terminal KEN box required to form the MCC.

36572322,Reconstruction of primary and secondary aortic infections with an antimicrobial graft.,"In situ reconstruction (ISR) with autologous veins is the preferred method in infectious native aortic aneurysms (INAAs) or vascular (endo)graft infection (VGEI). However, access to biological substitutes can prove difficult and lacks versatility. This study evaluates survival and freedom from reinfection after ISR of INAA/VGEI using the antimicrobial Intergard Synergy graft combining silver and triclosan.
From February 2014 to April 2020, 86 antimicrobial grafts were implanted for aortic infection. The diagnosis of INAA/VGEI and reinfection was established based on the Management of Aortic Graft Infection Collaboration criteria. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank P values.
The antimicrobial graft was implanted in 32 cases of INAA, 28 of VGI, and 26 of VEI. The median age was 69.0 (interquartile range: 62.0; 74.0), with a history of coronary artery disease (n = 21; 24.4%), chronic kidney disease (n = 11; 12.8%), cancer (n = 21; 24.4%), and immunosuppression (n = 27; 31.4%). Imaging showed infiltration (n = 14; 16.3%), air (n = 10; 11.6%), and rupture (n = 16; 18.6% including 22 aortoenteric fistulae [AEnF]). Symptoms included fever (n = 37; 43.0%), shock (n = 11; 12.8%), and pain (n = 47; 54.7%).

38650020,Meta-analysis of the global distribution of clinically relevant CYP2C8 alleles and their inferred functional consequences.,"CYP2C8 is responsible for the metabolism of 5% of clinically prescribed drugs, including antimalarials, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. Genetic variability is an important factor that influences CYP2C8 activity and modulates the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of its substrates.
We profiled the genetic landscape of CYP2C8 variability using data from 96 original studies and data repositories that included a total of 33,185 unrelated participants across 44 countries and 43 ethnic groups. The reduced function allele CYP2C8*2 was most common in West and Central Africa with frequencies of 16-36.9%, whereas it was rare in Europe and Asia (< 2%). In contrast, CYP2C8*3 and CYP2C8*4 were common throughout Europe and the Americas (6.9-19.8% for *3 and 2.3-7.5% for *4), but rare in African and East Asian populations. Importantly, we observe pronounced differences (> 2.3-fold) between neighboring countries and even between geographically overlapping populations. Overall, we found that 20-60% of individuals in Africa and Europe carry at least one CYP2C8 allele associated with reduced metabolism and increased adverse event risk of the anti-malarial amodiaquine. Furthermore, up to 60% of individuals of West African ancestry harbored variants that reduced the clearance of pioglitazone, repaglinide, paclitaxel and ibuprofen. In contrast, reduced function alleles are only found in < 2% of East Asian and 8.3-12.8% of South and West Asian individuals.
Combined, the presented analyses mapped the genetic and inferred functional variability of CYP2C8 with high ethnogeographic resolution. These results can serve as a valuable resource for CYP2C8 allele frequencies and distribution estimates of CYP2C8 phenotypes that could help identify populations at risk upon treatment with CYP2C8 substrates.

A Clinical Evidence-Based Pathology Study of 235 Unifocal Encapsulated Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas, with Emphasis on the Diagnosis of Noninvasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features.","Background: The percentage of papillae is a crucial criterion in differentiating noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) from papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) and in subclassifying PTC into classic and follicular variant. Since the description of NIFTP, three studies have shown that the presence of any papillae may be associated with nodal metastasis, which led to modification of the NIFTP criterion from <1% papillae to no true papillae allowed. We aim at providing clinical evidence-based data on the impact that papillary growth has on nodal spread and tumor genotype in tumors previously diagnosed as encapsulated unifocal PTC. Methods: A meticulous histopathologic examination was performed on 235 cases previously diagnosed as unifocal encapsulated PTC (U-EPTC). One hundred of these cases were subjected to BRAFV600E and NRASQ61R immunohistochemistry. Results: In our cohort, 27 patients (12%) had lymph node metastasis (N1) at the time of initial resection. Overall, 89% of the tumors in the N1 group contained >=50% papillae, compared with 13% in the N0/Nx group. Nodal metastases were only present in tumors with >=1% papillae. In noninvasive U-EPTC (n = 161), N1 disease was seen only in tumors with >=10% papillae. A higher percentage of papillae within the tumor also correlated with an increased frequency of BRAFV600E and decreased rate of NRASQ61R. None of the 26 NRAS-positive cases had nodal disease, including the invasive tumors. Among 216 patients with follow-up (median: 5.2 years), 3 patients (1.5%) had distant metastases, all detected at the initial presentation. All three tumors displayed 100% follicular growth, and capsular or vascular invasion. There was no locoregional recurrence in the entire cohort. Conclusion: In U-EPTC, there is a strong correlation between high percentage of papillary growth, presence of nodal metastasis, and BRAF+/RAS- genotype regardless of invasive status. Nodal metastases were not seen in tumors with <1% papillae irrespective of invasive status. These findings indicate that the initial criterion of <1% papillae is still valid for the diagnosis of NIFTP.

We describe three humans homozygous for a loss-of-function FLT3LG variant with a history of various recurrent infections, including severe cutaneous warts. The patients' bone marrow (BM) was hypoplastic, with low levels of hematopoietic progenitors, particularly myeloid and B cell precursors.

25600436,Identification of chimeric antigen receptors that mediate constitutive or inducible proliferation of T cells.,"This study compared second-generation chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) encoding signaling domains composed of CD28, ICOS, and 4-1BB (TNFRSF9). Here, we report that certain CARs endow T cells with the ability to undergo long-term autonomous proliferation. Transduction of primary human T cells with lentiviral vectors encoding some of the CARs resulted in sustained proliferation for up to 3 months following a single stimulation through the T-cell receptor (TCR). Sustained numeric expansion was independent of cognate antigen and did not require the addition of exogenous cytokines or feeder cells after a single stimulation of the TCR and CD28. Results from gene array and functional assays linked sustained cytokine secretion and expression of T-bet (TBX21), EOMES, and GATA-3 to the effect. Sustained expression of the endogenous IL2 locus has not been reported in primary T cells. Sustained proliferation was dependent on CAR structure and high expression, the latter of which was necessary but not sufficient. The mechanism involves constitutive signaling through NF-kappaB, AKT, ERK, and NFAT. The propagated CAR T cells retained a diverse TCR repertoire, and cellular transformation was not observed. The CARs with a constitutive growth phenotype displayed inferior antitumor effects and engraftment in vivo. Therefore, the design of CARs that have a nonconstitutive growth phenotype may be a strategy to improve efficacy and engraftment of CAR T cells.

30962859,Increased breast cancer risk in women with neurofibromatosis type 1: a meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a cancer predisposing syndrome. Studies suggest that women < 50 years old (y.o.) with NF1 have an increased breast cancer (BC) incidence and BC associated mortality. However, this has not been widely recognized secondary to small study populations. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted through database searches for BC and NF1: 3456 articles identified, 166 reviewed, 58 used for descriptive analysis and 4 utilized for meta-analysis. Fisher's exact tests, Kaplan-Meier curves and random-effects meta-analysis models were used for analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-six cases of NF1 and female BC were identified with a median age of 46 years at diagnosis; 53% were <  50. Peak age of BC diagnosis was between 34 to 44 years. Women < 50 y.o. presented with more advanced disease vs. those >=50 (56% vs. 22% stage III-IV, respectively; p = 0.005). Median survival for the entire cohort was 5 years vs. the reported median BC survival of over 20 years in the general population using the SEER database. Median age at BC death was 48.5 years; 64% of deceased patients were <  50. Meta-analysis of a total of 4178 women with NF1 revealed a BC standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 3.07 (95%CI 2.16-4.38) for women with NF1 vs. the general population. Women < 50 y.o. demonstrated a higher SIR of 5.08 (95%CI 3.77-6.81) compared to 1.92 (95%CI 1.40-2.63) if >=50 y.o. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature review and meta-analysis suggests that women with NF1 <  50 y.o. have a five-fold increased risk of BC, present with more advanced disease, and may have an increased BC related mortality. Increased awareness and implementation of recent National Comprehensive Cancer Network early BC screening guidelines for this high-risk patient population is essential.

25862606,Simultaneous assessment of NF-kappaB/p65 phosphorylation and nuclear localization using imaging flow cytometry.,"Aberrant activity of Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is associated with many diseases and is therapeutically targeted. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation of the RELA/p65 sub-unit, are essential for cytoplasmic to nuclear localization of NF-kappaB/p65 and initiation of transcription of downstream target genes. Immunoblot and phospho-flow cytometry have been used to study the relationship between phosphorylation motifs and NF-kappaB activation and microscopic analysis of nuclear localization of p65 is also used as a parameter for activation. The labor intensive nature of these approaches commonly limits the number of sampling points or replicates. Recent insights into the relationship between p65 phosphorylation motifs and their nuclear localization indicate that these parameters have different significances and should not be used interchangeably. In this study, we demonstrate feasibility and reproducibility of studying the relationship between p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation using imaging flow cytometry (IFC). TNFalpha- or PMA/Ionomycin-induced phosphorylation of p65 at serine 529 in cell line models and healthy donor lymphocytes served as the experimental model. IFC analysis demonstrated that expression of phosphorylated serine 529 (P-p65(s529)) increased rapidly following stimulation and that nuclear localization of P-p65(s529) followed the nuclear localization pattern of total p65. However, in the presence of tacrolimus, P-p65(s529) expression was inhibited without affecting nuclear localization of total p65. The data demonstrate the application of IFC to simultaneously assess phosphorylation of p65 and its cellular localization and the results obtained by this analysis corroborate current insights regarding the specific effect of tacrolimus on serine 529 phosphorylation.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25862606.txt,0,"Aberrant activity of Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is associated with many diseases and is therapeutically targeted.

31498304,In Vivo Inhibition of MicroRNA to Decrease Tumor Growth in Mice.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression through their ability to destabilize mRNA and inhibit translation of target mRNAs. An ever-increasing number of studies have identified miRNAs as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and also as therapeutic targets, adding an extra dimension to cancer evaluation and treatment. In the context of thyroid cancer, tumorigenesis results not only from mutations in important genes, but also from the overexpression of many miRNAs. Accordingly, the role of miRNAs in the control of thyroid gene expression is evolving as an important mechanism in cancer. Herein, we present a protocol to examine the effects of miRNA-inhibitor delivery as a therapeutic modality in thyroid cancer using human tumor xenograft and orthotopic mouse models. After engineering stable thyroid tumoral cells expressing GFP and luciferase, cells are injected into nude mice to develop tumors, which can be followed by bioluminescence. The in vivo inhibition of a miRNA can reduce tumor growth and upregulate miRNA gene targets. This method can be used to assess the importance of a determined miRNA in vivo, in addition to identifying new therapeutic targets.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31498304.txt,1,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression through their ability to destabilize mRNA and inhibit translation of target mRNAs.

28146470,Rare and low-frequency coding variants alter human adult height.,"Height is a highly heritable, classic polygenic trait with approximately 700 common associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies so far. Here, we report 83 height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele frequencies (in the range of 0.1-4.8%) and effects of up to 2 centimetres per allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the average effect of common variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1-2 centimetres per allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth.

31597840,The differential diagnosis of classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN): the updated WHO criteria.,"The classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), are characterized by clonal myeloproliferation without features of myelodysplasia. The diagnostic approach proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) uses clinical features, peripheral blood counts and smear analysis, bone marrow (BM) morphology, karyotype and molecular genetic tests to classify MPN subtypes. The detection of characteristic driver mutations like JAK2V617F, JAK2 exon 12, MPL, and calrecticulin (CALR) is a major diagnostic feature. JAK2 mutations are detected in more than 90% of patients with PV and are therefore used as highly sensitive clonal marker in this subtype. However, JAK2 mutations may also occur in ET and PMF, while CALR is virtually not seen in PV. Therefore, BM remains the central diagnostic platform and is essential for distinguishing ET from pre-fibrotic PMF and diagnosing cases which do not express JAK2, MPL or CALR ('wild-type' or 'triple-negative' MPN). The standardization of relevant BM features is mandatory to recognize characteristic and easy to assess patterns that enable an accurate discrimination between the MPN subtypes.

25039926,The presence of mast cell clonality in patients with unexplained anaphylaxis.,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which mast cells in patients with unexplained anaphylaxis (UEA) are triggered remain elusive. Onset of episodes is unpredictable and often recurrent. The substantial overlap between the clinical manifestations of UEA and clonal mast cell disorders (CMD) suggests an association between these rare disorders. The two forms of CMD characterized to date are systemic mastocytosis (SM) and monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS). OBJECTIVE: To examine the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of UEA reflects the presence of aberrant subpopulations of mast cells. METHODS: Thirty (14 men, 16 women) patients (>= 18 years) suffering from UEA and with no signs of cutaneous mastocytosis were recruited. Patients underwent an initial complete allergy work-up to confirm the diagnosis of UEA. Level of baseline serum tryptase (sBT) and total IgE were determined. In addition, a bone marrow examination was performed on all 30 patients to investigate possible underlying CMD. RESULTS: Fourteen (47%) of our cases (nine men, five women) were diagnosed with CMD: 10 with SM and four with MMAS. Four of the 10 patients with SM had mast cell aggregates in their bone marrow. All patients with SM exhibited a sBT level > 11.4 ng/mL, whereas this level was elevated in only two of those with MMAS and four with UAE but not diagnosed with CMD. Total IgE levels were lower in the group of patients with CMD (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The pathogenic mechanism underlying UEA could be explained by the presence of immunophenotypically aberrant mast cells with clonal markers in 47% of our subjects, indicating that clonal mast cell disorders are present in a substantial subset of these patients. Thus, the presence of CMD should be considered in patients with UEA if they have an elevated level of sBT (>= 11.4 ng/mL) and cardiovascular symptoms such as syncope.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25039926.txt,0,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which mast cells in patients with unexplained anaphylaxis (UEA) are triggered remain elusive.

Immunohistochemistry is helpful for accurate diagnosis of CMPT. Sub-lobectomy may be proper and adjuvant treatment should be avoided since the disease is now prone to benign lesions. Furthermore, since the biological behavior of this tumor is not yet fully elucidated, additional case data are essential for accurate conclusions.",['tumor'],1
29385279,Chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK-cells: A single-institution review with emphasis on relative utility of multimodality diagnostic tools.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK-cells (CLPD-NK) manifests as a persistent increase (>=2 x 109 /L, for > 6 months) of mature NK-cells in peripheral blood with an indolent clinical course. The disease is rare, and only limited case series have been published. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 11 patients with CLPD-NK diagnosed at our institution between 2005 and 2017. RESULTS: Patients included 7 men and 4 women with a median age of 60 years (range, 25-89 years). Ten patients (91%) had cytopenias. Bone marrow involvement by CLPD-NK ranged from 5-15%. The most commonly detected antigenic aberrancies by  low cytometry immunophenotyping were as follows: CD7decreased/dim (30%), CD8uniform+ (36%), CD56-/partial (73%), CD94bright (55%), and KIR restriction (100%). JAK/STAT pathway mutations were detected in 8 of 10 (80%) patients and involved STAT3 (n = 7) and JAK3 (n = 1). The presence of mutations tended to correlate with the occurrence of other cytopenias (anemia/thrombocytopenia) and requirement for treatment. Seven patients received single-agent therapy, with amelioration of symptoms; 4 patients were observed. There were no disease-associated deaths or progression to more aggressive disease during the follow-up interval (median, 17 months). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CLPD-NK have an indolent clinical course and frequent hematologic manifestations that are responsive to single-agent therapy.

This study aimed to determine whether the response to TPTD might be influenced by genetic factors.
We searched for predictors of the response of bone mineral density (BMD) to TPTD using a two-stage genome-wide association study in 437 patients with osteoporosis from three referral centres. Demographic and clinical data including the response of BMD to treatment at the lumbar spine and hip were extracted from the medical records of each participant.
Allelic variation at rs6430612 on chromosome 2, close <i>to the CXCR4</i> gene was associated with the response of spine BMD to TPTD at a genome wide significant level (p=9.2×10<sup>-9</sup> beta=-0.35 (-0.47 to -0.23)). The increase in BMD was almost twice as great in AA homozygotes at rs6430612 as compared with GG homozygotes with intermediate values in heterozygotes. The same variant was also associated with response of femoral neck and total hip BMD (p=0.007). An additional locus on chromosome 19 tagged by rs73056959 was associated with the response of femoral neck BMD to TPTD (p=3.5×10<sup>-9</sup>, beta=-1.61 (-2.14 to -1.07)).
Genetic factors influence the response to TPTD at the lumbar spine and hip with a magnitude of effect that is clinically relevant.

25780857,Evaluation of von Willebrand factor phenotypes and genotypes in Hemophilia A patients with and without identified F8 mutations.,"BACKGROUND: Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in factor VIII (FVIII). von Willebrand disease (VWD) is characterized by a quantitative or qualitative defect in von Willebrand factor (VWF). Patients with VWD with severely low VWF or VWD Type 2N (VWD2N), a VWD subtype distinguished by defective VWF binding to FVIII, may have reduced FVIII levels secondary to their VWD. These patients superficially resemble patients with HA and pose a potential for misdiagnosis. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the unexplained cause of bleeding in HA patients without known FVIII mutations by assessing plasma VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), FVIII binding capacities and VWF genotypes. PATIENTS/METHODS: Thirty-seven of 1027 patients with HA studied as part of the Hemophilia Inhibitor Research Study lacked identifiable F8 mutations. These patients (cases) and 73 patients with identified F8 mutations (controls) were evaluated for VWF:Ag, a patient's VWF capacity to bind FVIII (VWF:FVIIIB) and VWF sequence. RESULTS: Four cases had VWF:Ag < 3 IU dL(-1) and VWF mutations consistent with Type 3 VWD. Six cases and one control were heterozygous for mutations previously reported to cause Type 1 VWD (VWD1) (n = five cases and one control) or predicted to be deleterious by Polyphen2 and SIFT prediction tools (n = 1 case). One control had VWF:Ag < 30 IU dL(-1) and seven patients (four cases and three controls), including two cases who were heterozygous for a known VWD2N mutation, had reduced VWF:FVIIIB.

29276006,WNT Signaling Perturbations Underlie the Genetic Heterogeneity of Robinow Syndrome.,"Locus heterogeneity characterizes a variety of skeletal dysplasias often due to interacting or overlapping signaling pathways. Robinow syndrome is a skeletal disorder historically refractory to molecular diagnosis, potentially stemming from substantial genetic heterogeneity. All current known pathogenic variants reside in genes within the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway including ROR2, WNT5A, and more recently, DVL1 and DVL3. However, ~70% of autosomal-dominant Robinow syndrome cases remain molecularly unsolved. To investigate this missing heritability, we recruited 21 families with at least one family member clinically diagnosed with Robinow or Robinow-like phenotypes and performed genetic and genomic studies. In total, four families with variants in FZD2 were identified as well as three individuals from two families with biallelic variants in NXN that co-segregate with the phenotype. Importantly, both FZD2 and NXN are relevant protein partners in the WNT5A interactome, supporting their role in skeletal development. In addition to confirming that clustered -1 frameshifting variants in DVL1 and DVL3 are the main contributors to dominant Robinow syndrome, we also found likely pathogenic variants in candidate genes GPC4 and RAC3, both linked to the Wnt signaling pathway. These data support an initial hypothesis that Robinow syndrome results from perturbation of the Wnt/PCP pathway, suggest specific relevant domains of the proteins involved, and reveal key contributors in this signaling cascade during human embryonic development. Contrary to the view that non-allelic genetic heterogeneity hampers gene discovery, this study demonstrates the utility of rare disease genomic studies to parse gene function in human developmental pathways.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\29276006.txt,0,"Locus heterogeneity characterizes a variety of skeletal dysplasias often due to interacting or overlapping signaling pathways.

26471738,Evaluation of romiplostim for the treatment of secondary failure of platelet recovery among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.,"Secondary failure of platelet recovery (SFPR) is a serious complication observed in approximately 20% of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Although the standard therapeutic approach has been frequent platelet transfusions, romiplostim, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, may have utility in treating SFPR. The primary objective of this single-center retrospective analysis was to assess effectiveness of romiplostim for SFPR and to evaluate patient factors which may influence clinical outcomes. The primary outcome measure of response was defined as achievement of platelet count >= 50 x 109/L without transfusions for >= 7 consecutive days. During the study period, 93 patients underwent HSCT and 13 (13.9%) received romiplostim for SFPR. Seven patients (53.8%) responded to romiplostim, requiring a median of three doses (range 1-6) to achieve independence from platelet transfusions. Disease relapse occurred in 38.5% of all patients, two responders and three nonresponders. Median survival post-HSCT was 753 days among responders and 266 days among nonresponders ( p = 0.0375). No serious adverse events were reported, and rates of graft-versus-host disease did not increase following administration of romiplostim.

24389310,SRSF2-p95 hotspot mutation is highly associated with advanced forms of mastocytosis and mutations in epigenetic regulator genes.,"Mastocytosis is a rare and chronic disease with phenotypes ranging from indolent to severe. Prognosis for this disease is variable and very few biomarkers to predict disease evolution or outcome are currently known. We have performed comprehensive screening in our large cohort of mastocytosis patients for mutations previously found in other myeloid diseases and that could serve as prognostic indicators. KIT, SRSF2-P95 and TET2 mutations were by far the most frequent, detected in 81%, 24% and 21% of patients, respectively. Where TET2 and SRSF2-P95 mutation both correlated with advanced disease phenotypes, SRSF2-P95 hotspot mutation was found almost exclusively in patients diagnosed with associated clonal hematologic non-mast cell disease. Statistically, TET2 and SRSF2-P95 mutations were highly associated, suggesting a mechanistic link between these two factors. Finally, analysis of both clonal and sorted cell populations from patients confirms the presence of these mutations in the mast cell component of the disease, suggests an ontological mutation hierarchy and provides evidence for the expansion of multiple clones.

28432683,Prospective evaluation of the diagnostic value of sensitive KIT D816V mutation analysis of blood in adults with suspected systemic mastocytosis.,"BACKGROUND: Sensitive KIT D816V mutation analysis of blood has been proposed to guide bone marrow (BM) investigation in suspected systemic mastocytosis (SM). The aim of this prospective study was for the first time to compare the D816V status of the ""screening blood sample"" used to guide BM biopsy in suspected SM to the outcome of the subsequent BM investigation. METHODS: Fifty-eight adult patients with suspected SM were included. The outcome of sensitive KIT D816V analysis of blood was compared to the result of the BM investigation. RESULTS: Screening blood samples from 44 of 58 patients tested D816V-positive. In 43 of these, SM was subsequently diagnosed in the BM investigation. One patient with a D816V-positive screening sample was diagnosed with monoclonal MC activation syndrome. Screening blood samples from 14 patients tested D816V-negative. SM was subsequently diagnosed in five of these, whereas nine patients did not fulfill any diagnostic SM criteria (excluding tryptase criterion). Of the 48 SM patients, 90% tested D816V-positive. Thirteen SM patients presented with Hymenoptera venom-induced anaphylaxis, no skin lesions, and baseline serum tryptase <=20 ng/mL. Of these, 92% tested D816V-positive in the screening blood sample. CONCLUSION: This prospective study demonstrates that a D816V-positive result in a screening blood sample identifies SM among patients with hymenoptera venom-induced anaphylaxis in whom the diagnosis would most probably have been missed, with potential severe implications.

We undertook a retrospective study of robotic-assisted myomectomy (RM) patients at our academic medical center to determine symptomatic recurrence and reoperation rates in those who did versus did not receive preoperative GnRH therapy. Only patients, who had their index myomectomy at least 2 years prior to the chart review, were included in this study. Of 118 RM patients identified between January 2005 and December 2009, 17 patients (14.4 %) had symptomatic recurrence as early as 5 months to as late as 30 months postoperatively. The symptomatic recurrence group had significantly higher preoperative GnRH use (35 vs 9 % non-recurrence; p = 0.009). A total of 7.6 % of all patients underwent reoperation.

30092282,RNA binding protein HuR regulates extracellular matrix gene expression and pH homeostasis independent of controlling HIF-1alpha signaling in nucleus pulposus cells.,"Nucleus pulposus (NP) cells reside in the hypoxic niche of the intervertebral disc. Studies have demonstrated that RNA-binding protein HuR modulates hypoxic signaling in several cancers, however, its function in the disc is unknown. HuR did not show cytoplasmic translocation in hypoxia and its silencing did not alter levels of Hif-1alpha or HIF-targets in NP cells. RNA-Sequencing data revealed that important extracellular matrix-related genes including several collagens, MMPs, aggrecan, Tgf-beta3 and Sdc4 were regulated by HuR. Further analysis of HuR-silenced NP cells confirmed that HuR maintained expression of these matrix genes. We confirmed decreased levels of secreted collagen I and Sdc4 and increased pro-MMP13 in HuR-knockdown cells. In addition, messenger ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation demonstrated HuR binding to Tgf-beta3 and Sdc4 mRNAs. Interestingly, while HuR bound to Hif-1alpha and Vegf mRNAs, it was clear that compensatory mechanisms sustained their expression when HuR was silenced. Noteworthy, despite the presence of multiple HuR-binding sites and reported interaction in other cell types, HuR showed no binding to Pgk1, Eno1, Pdk1 and Pfkfb3 in NP cells. Metabolic studies showed a significant decrease in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and acidic pH in HuR-silenced NP cells, without appreciable change in total OCR. These changes were likely due to decreased Ca12 expression in HuR silenced cells. Taken together, our study demonstrates for the first time that HuR regulates extracellular matrix (ECM) and pH homeostasis of NP cells and has important implications in the maintenance of intervertebral disc health.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\30092282.txt,0,"Nucleus pulposus (NP) cells reside in the hypoxic niche of the intervertebral disc.

26911863,A novel follicle-stimulating hormone receptor mutation causing primary ovarian failure: a fertility application of whole exome sequencing.,"STUDY QUESTION: Can whole exome sequencing (WES) and in vitro validation studies be used to find the causative genetic etiology in a patient with primary ovarian failure and infertility? SUMMARY ANSWER: A novel follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) mutation was found by WES and shown, via in vitro flow cytometry studies, to affect membrane trafficking. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: WES may diagnose up to 25-35% of patients with suspected disorders of sex development (DSD). FSHR mutations are an extremely rare cause of 46, XX gonadal dysgenesis with primary amenorrhea due to hypergonadotropic ovarian failure. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A WES study was followed by flow cytometry studies of mutant protein function. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study subjects were two Turkish sisters with hypergonadotropic primary amenorrhea, their parents and two unaffected sisters. The affected siblings and both parents were sequenced (trio-WES). Transient transfection of HEK 293T cells was performed with a vector containing wild-type FSHR as well as the novel FSHR variant that was discovered by WES. Cellular localization of FSHR protein as well as FSH-stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) production was evaluated using flow cytometry. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Both affected sisters were homozygous for a previously unreported missense mutation (c.1222G>T, p.Asp408Tyr) in the second transmembrane domain of FSHR. Modeling predicted disrupted secondary structure. Flow cytometry demonstrated an average of 48% reduction in cell-surface signal detection (P < 0.01). The mean fluorescent signal for cAMP (second messenger of FSHR), stimulated by FSH, was reduced by 50% in the mutant-transfected cells (P < 0.01). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is an in vitro validation. All novel purported genetic variants can be clinically reported only as 'variants of uncertain significance' until more patients with a similar phenotype are discovered with the same variant. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: We report the first WES-discovered FSHR mutation, validated by quantitative flow cytometry. WES is a valuable tool for diagnosis of rare genetic diseases, and flow cytometry allows for quantitative characterization of purported variants. WES-assisted diagnosis allows for treatments aimed at the underlying molecular etiology of disease. Future studies should focus on pharmacological and assisted reproductive treatments aimed at the disrupted FSHR, so that patients with FSH resistance can be treated by personalized medicine.

38186869,DKK3 as a potential novel biomarker in patients with autosomal polycystic kidney disease.,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disease, and leads to a steady loss of kidney function in adulthood. The variable course of the disease makes it necessary to identify the patients with rapid disease progression who will benefit the most from targeted therapies and interventions. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging-based volumetry of the kidney is the most commonly used tool for this purpose. Biomarkers that can be easily and quantitatively determined, which allow a prediction of the loss of kidney function, have not yet been established in clinical practice. The glycoprotein Dickkopf 3 (DKK3) which is secreted in the renal tubular epithelium upon stress and contributes to tubulointerstitial fibrosis via the <i>Wnt</i> signaling pathway, was recently described as a biomarker for estimating risk of kidney function loss, but has not been investigated for ADPKD. This study aimed to obtain a first insight into whether DKK3 may indeed improve outcome prediction in ADPKD in the future.
In 184 ADPKD patients from the AD(H)PKD registry and 47 healthy controls, the urinary DKK3 (uDKK3) levels were determined using ELISA. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the potential of these values in outcome prediction.
ADPKD patients showed significantly higher uDKK3 values compared with the controls (mean 1970 ± 5287 vs 112 ± 134.7 pg/mg creatinine). Furthermore, there was a steady increase in uDKK3 with an increase in the Mayo class (A/B 1262 ± 2315 vs class D/E 3104 ± 7627 pg/mg creatinine), the best-established biomarker of progression in ADPKD. uDKK3 also correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Patients with <i>PKD1</i> mutations show higher uDKK3 levels compared with <i>PKD2</i> patients (<i>PKD1</i>: 2304 ± 5119; <i>PKD2</i>: 506.6 ± 526.8 pg/mg creatinine). Univariate linear regression showed uDKK3 as a significant predictor of future eGFR slope estimation. In multiple linear regression this effect was not significant in models also containing height-adjusted total kidney volume and/or eGFR. However, adding both copeptin levels and the interaction term between copeptin and uDKK3 to the model resulted in a significant predictive value of all these three variables and the highest R<sup>2</sup> of all models examined (∼0.5).
uDKK3 shows a clear correlation with the Mayo classification in patients with ADPKD. uDKK3 levels correlated with kidney function, which could indicate that uDKK3 also predicts a disproportionate loss of renal function in this collective. Interestingly, we found an interaction between copeptin and uDKK3 in our prediction models and the best model containing both variables and their interaction term resulted in a fairly good explanation of variance in eGFR slope compared with previous models. Considering the limited number of patients in these analyses, future studies will be required to confirm the results.

We have shown that rectal tumors are comprised of multiple genetically distinct sub-clones. Unique sub-clones within tumors may harbor mutations which contribute to inter-patient variation in response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Analysis of the influence of nCRT on the extent and nature of intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity in rectal cancer may provide insights into mechanisms of resistance. Locally advanced rectal cancer patients underwent pre-treatment biopsies. At the time of surgery, tissue from the treated tumor was obtained and analyzed. Pre- and post-treatment specimens were subjected to whole exome and confirmatory deep sequencing for somatic mutations. Copy number variation was assessed using OncoScan SNP arrays. Genomic data were analyzed using PyClone to identify sub-clonal tumor population following nCRT. Alterations that persisted or were enriched in the post-treatment tumor specimen following nCRT were defined for each patient. Thirty-two samples were obtained from ten patients. PyClone identified 2 to 10 genetic sub-clones per tumor. Substantial changes in the proportions of individual sub-clones in pre- versus post-treatment tumor material were found in all patients. Resistant sub-clones recurrently contained mutations in TP53, APC, ABCA13, MUC16, and THSD4. Recurrent copy number variation was observed across multiple chromosome regions after nCRT. Pathway analysis including variant alleles and copy number changes associated with resistant sub-clones revealed significantly altered pathways, especially those linked to the APC and TP53 genes, which were the two most frequently mutated genes.

24452316,Variable clinical expressivity of STAT3 mutation in hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome: genetic and clinical studies of six patients.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Autosomal dominant Hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) is a rare and complex primary immunodeficiency that affects multiple systems. Mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene cause AD-HIES. These mutations have a dominant-negative effect and the presence of such mutations is associated with a clinical phenotype. We aim to describe genetic and clinical characteristics of patients with AD-HIES in our clinic and to highlight the variability of clinical patterns in the same family. METHODS: We describe six patients, four individuals of the same family and two unrelated patients. All patients were given a clinical score based on disease phenotype according to the National Institute of Health (NIH) score. Mutation analysis of STAT3 was done by PCR amplification of all coding exons followed by bidirectional sequencing using the BigDye kit v1.1 and an ABI3700 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). RESULTS: All six patients had DNA binding region point mutations: a proband and his three children with p.Phe384Leu mutation, a patient with p.Arg382Trp substitution and a patient with p.Arg382Gln mutation. All of these mutations were previously reported. Patients differed in infectious, immunologic and somatic features. We observed an extreme variability in disease phenotype within the reported family with one genetically affected patient displaying an 'unaffected' phenotype.

25122853,Poor performance of the determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab combo fourth-generation rapid test for detection of acute infections in a National Household Survey in Swaziland.,"Fourth-generation HIV rapid tests (RTs) claim to detect both p24 antigen (Ag) and HIV antibodies (Ab) for early identification of acute infections, important for targeting prevention and reducing HIV transmission. In a nationally representative household survey in Swaziland, 18,172 adults, age 18 to 49 years, received home-based HIV rapid testing in 2010 and 2011. Of the 18,172 individuals, 5,822 (32.0%) were Ab positive (Ab(+)) by the Determine HIV-1/2 Ab/Ab combo test, and 5,789 (99.4%) of those were confirmed to be reactive in the Uni-Gold test. Determine combo identified 12 individuals as having acute infections (Ag(+)/Ab negative [Ab(-)]); however, none had detectable HIV-1 RNA and 8 of 12 remained HIV negative at their 6-week follow-up visit (4 were lost to follow-up). All RT-nonreactive samples were pooled and tested by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) to identify acute infections. NAAT identified 13 (0.1%) of the 12,338 HIV antibody-negative specimens as HIV RNA positive, with RNA levels ranging from 300 to >10,000,000 copies/ml. However, none of them were Ag(+) by Determine combo. Follow-up testing of 12 of the 13 NAAT-positive individuals at 6 months demonstrated 12 seroconversions (1 individual was lost to follow-up). Therefore, the Determine combo test had a sensitivity of 0% (95% confidence interval, 0 to 28) and positive predictive value of 0% for the detection of acute infections.

Of the 18,172 individuals, 5,822 (32.0) were Ab positive (Ab()) by the Determine HIV-12 AbAb combo test, and 5,789 (99.4) of those were confirmed to be reactive in the Uni-Gold test. Determine combo identified 12 individuals as having acute infections (Ag()Ab negative Ab(-)); however, none had detectable HIV-1 RNA and 8 of 12 remained HIV negative at their 6-week follow-up visit (4 were lost to follow-up). All RT-nonreactive samples were pooled and tested by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) to identify acute infections. NAAT identified 13 (0.1) of the 12,338 HIV antibody-negative specimens as HIV RNA positive, with RNA levels ranging from 300 to 10,000,000 copiesml. However, none of them were Ag() by Determine combo. Follow-up testing of 12 of the 13 NAAT-positive individuals at 6 months demonstrated 12 seroconversions (1 individual was lost to follow-up).

28500564,Calcium Signaling: From Normal B Cell Development to Tolerance Breakdown and Autoimmunity.,"Maintenance of self-tolerance of auto-reactive lymphocytes is a fundamental mechanism to prevent the onset of autoimmune diseases. Deciphering the mechanisms involved in the deregulations leading to tolerance disruption and autoimmunity is still a major area of interest to identify new therapeutic targets and options. Ca2+ signaling plays a major role in B cell normal development and is therefore finely tuned by B cell receptor (BCR)-dependent and independent pathways. Developmental changes in the characteristics of BCR-dependent Ca2+ signals as well as the modulation of basal intracellular concentration ([Ca2+]i) contribute strongly to self-tolerance maintaining mechanisms responsible for the physical or functional elimination of autoreactive B cells such as clonal deletion, receptor editing, and anergy. Implication of Ca2+ signals in B tolerance mechanisms mainly occurs through the specific activation of transcriptional programs depending on the amplitude, shape, and duration of Ca2+ signals.

METHODS: We collected clinical data of patients with hereditary cancers, identified via genetic testing (or clinically diagnosed in cases of Cowden syndrome or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), and treated in our gynecological department from 2012 to 2018. RESULTS: Fifteen patients had hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), 6 had Lynch syndrome, 2 had Cowden syndrome, and 2 had Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Five patients diagnosed with HBOC were younger than 40 years at diagnosis. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) was performed on 1 patient with a BRCA1 mutation at age 38 years. Seven patients overall underwent RRSO, and none had malignancies on pathological examinations. Peritoneal washing cytology (PWC) was suspicious for malignancy in one patient; however, subsequent PWC at 6 months after RRSO was negative. A patient with endometrial cancer and Lynch syndrome and a patient with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) and Cowden syndrome strongly desired fertility preservation.

DSDs are relatively rare, but their incidence is becoming alarmingly common in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Their etiologies and mechanisms are poorly understood. Therefore, we have investigated cytogenetic profiles, including telomere dysfunction, in a retrospective cohort of Senegalese DSD patients.
Peripheral blood lymphocytes were sampled from 35 DSD patients (mean age: 3.3 years; range 0-18 years) admitted to two hospital centers in Dakar. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 150 healthy donors were used as a control. Conventional cytogenetics, telomere, and centromere staining followed by multiplex FISH, as well as FISH with <i>SRY</i>-specific probes, were employed.
Cytogenetic analysis identified 19 male and 13 female patients with apparently normal karyotypes, two patients with Turner syndrome, and one patient with Klinefelter syndrome. Additional structural chromosome aberrations were detected in 22% of the patients (8/35). Telomere analysis revealed a reduction in mean telomere lengths of DSD patients compared to those of healthy donors of similar age. This reduction in telomere length was associated with an increased rate of telomere aberrations (telomere loss and the formation of telomere doublets) and the presence of additional chromosomal aberrations.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate a correlation between telomere dysfunction and DSDs.

25963654,Spindle Checkpoint Factors Bub1 and Bub2 Promote DNA Double-Strand Break Repair by Nonhomologous End Joining.,"The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is essential for the preservation of genome integrity, as it efficiently repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Previous biochemical and genetic investigations have indicated that, despite the importance of this pathway, the entire complement of genes regulating NHEJ remains unknown. To address this, we employed a plasmid-based NHEJ DNA repair screen in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using 369 putative nonessential DNA repair-related components as queries. Among the newly identified genes associated with NHEJ deficiency upon disruption are two spindle assembly checkpoint kinases, Bub1 and Bub2. Both observation of resulting phenotypes and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Bub1 and -2, either alone or in combination with cell cycle regulators, are recruited near the DSB, where phosphorylated Rad53 or H2A accumulates. Large-scale proteomic analysis of Bub kinases phosphorylated in response to DNA damage identified previously unknown kinase substrates on Tel1 S/T-Q sites. Moreover, Bub1 NHEJ function appears to be conserved in mammalian cells. 53BP1, which influences DSB repair by NHEJ, colocalizes with human BUB1 and is recruited to the break sites. Thus, while Bub is not a core component of NHEJ machinery, our data support its dual role in mitotic exit and promotion of NHEJ repair in yeast and mammals.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25963654.txt,0,"The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is essential for the preservation of genome integrity, as it efficiently repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).

Recent evidence suggests that disturbances in specific intracellular signalling pathways, such as RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase, T-cell receptor (TCR)-phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1)-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), may play an essential role in the pathogenesis of CTCL. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanisms controlling disease development and progression in mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common form of CTCL. METHODS: We collected 100 samples that were submitted for diagnosis of, or a second opinion regarding, MF between 2001 and 2018, 80% of which were in the early clinical stages of the disease. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were used for histological review and to measure the expression by immunohistochemistry of surrogate markers of activation of the TCR-PLCG1-NFAT, JAK-STAT and NF-kappaB pathways. Folliculotropism and large-cell transformation were also examined. RESULTS: NFAT and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) markers showed a comparable activation status in early and advanced stages, while STAT3 activation was more frequent in advanced stages and was associated with large-cell transformation. Consistently with this observation, STAT3 activation occurred in parallel with MF progression in two initially MF-negative cases. A significant association of NFAT with NF-kappaB markers was also found, reflecting a common mechanism of activation in the two pathways. Genomic studies identified nine mutations in seven genes known to play a potential role in tumorigenesis in T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, including PLCG1, JAK3 and STAT3, which underlies the activation of these key cell-survival pathways. A higher mutational allele frequency was detected in advanced stages.

25399868,TRF2 and lamin A/C interact to facilitate the functional organization of chromosome ends.,"Telomeres protect the ends of linear genomes, and the gradual loss of telomeres is associated with cellular ageing. Telomere protection involves the insertion of the 3' overhang facilitated by telomere repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) into telomeric DNA, forming t-loops. We present evidence suggesting that t-loops can also form at interstitial telomeric sequences in a TRF2-dependent manner, forming an interstitial t-loop (ITL). We demonstrate that TRF2 association with interstitial telomeric sequences is stabilized by co-localization with A-type lamins (lamin A/C). We also find that lamin A/C interacts with TRF2 and that reduction in levels of lamin A/C or mutations in LMNA that cause an autosomal dominant premature ageing disorder--Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS)-lead to reduced ITL formation and telomere loss.

30177503,Inheritance of OCT4 predetermines fate choice in human embryonic stem cells.,"It is well known that clonal cells can make different fate decisions, but it is unclear whether these decisions are determined during, or before, a cell's own lifetime. Here, we engineered an endogenous fluorescent reporter for the pluripotency factor OCT4 to study the timing of differentiation decisions in human embryonic stem cells. By tracking single-cell OCT4 levels over multiple cell cycle generations, we found that the decision to differentiate is largely determined before the differentiation stimulus is presented and can be predicted by a cell's preexisting OCT4 signaling patterns.

31158106,Clinical implications of genetic aberrations in metastatic prostate cancer.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The utility of tumor genetic testing in metastatic prostate cancer is rapidly evolving - especially in respect to finding prognostic and predictive biomarkers. In this review, we describe genomic aberrations in clinically relevant pathways in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) for which therapeutic targeting is possible. RECENT FINDINGS: Recognizing the diverse array of genetic features within prostate cancer, the goal of testing in mCRPC is to match an individual patients' tumor with the best therapy. Approximately 20-25% of mCRPC patients have defects in DNA repair, which may be exploited with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, platinum-based chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. Choosing between the second-generation androgen inhibitors and chemotherapy may be informed through testing for androgen receptor splice variants or androgen receptor amplifications, but technology and outcomes are still being clarified. Genetic testing for mismatch repair deficiency (1% of mCRPC patients) is a standard of care, but may be expanded as other subpopulations that could respond to immunotherapy are found. SUMMARY: The era of precision medicine for prostate cancer is here, but is being refined. Further studies with newer technology and standardized analytical platforms are needed and must be matched with improvement in clinical care infrastructure.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31158106.txt,1,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The utility of tumor genetic testing in metastatic prostate cancer is rapidly evolving - especially in respect to finding prognostic and predictive biomarkers.

24967879,Gene expression profile in long-term non progressor HIV infected patients: in search of potential resistance factors.,"Long-term non-progressors (LTNP) represent a minority (1-5%) of HIV-infected individuals characterized by documented infection for more than 7-10 years, a stable CD4+ T cell count over 500/mm(3) and low viremia in the absence of antiretroviral treatment. Protective factors described so far such as the CCR5delta32 deletion, protective HLA alleles, or defective viruses fail to fully explain the partial protection phenotype. The existence of additional host resistance mechanisms in LTNP patients was investigated here using a whole human genome microarray study comparing gene expression profiles of unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from LTNP patients, HIV-1 infected patients under antiretroviral therapy with CD4+ T cell levels above 500/mm(3) (ST), as well as healthy individuals. Genes that were up- or downregulated exclusively in LTNP, ST or in both groups in comparison to controls were identified and classified in functional categories using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. ST and LTNP patient groups revealed distinct genetic profiles, regarding gene number in each category and up- or downregulation of specific genes, which could have a bearing on the outcome of each group. We selected some relevant genes to validate the differential expression using quantitative real-time qRT-PCR. Among others, we found several genes related to the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.

Despite their large size, ubiquitous expression, and irreplaceable roles in an ever-growing list of physiological processes, few Piezo channel-binding proteins have emerged. In this work, we found that MyoD (myoblast determination)-family inhibitor proteins (MDFIC and MDFI) are PIEZO1/2 interacting partners. These transcriptional regulators bind to PIEZO1/2 channels, regulating channel inactivation. Using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy, we mapped the interaction site in MDFIC to a lipidated, C-terminal helix that inserts laterally into the PIEZO1 pore module.

30931661,Clear Cell Variant of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma With Associated Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma: Description of an Extraordinary Case.,"Clear cell change is a rare observation in thyroid cancer, resulting from aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of lipids, glycogen, or thyroglobulin in the tumor cells. The phenomenon is most common for follicular thyroid neoplasia, with no definite coupling to patient outcome. The clear cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (ccPTC) is even more infrequent-making conclusions regarding prognosis difficult. Single reports describe distant metastases of ccPTCs as well as co-occurrence with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). In this report, a case of a therapy-resistant ccPTC dedifferentiating into an ATC is characterized from morphological and immunohistochemical standpoints. The patient was a 79-year-old female presenting with a 45-mm nodule in her right thyroid lobe. A first round of cytology raised the suspicion of PTC, but a repeated biopsy verified an ATC diagnosis. Neoadjuvant doxorubicin and external irradiation therapy was administered, and the patient developed lung metastases concomitantly. A palliative lobectomy was performed, and the final diagnosis was a ccPTC with focal dedifferentiation into an ATC. Intriguingly, the ccPTC component was viable and dominated the lesion. The clear cell morphology stemmed from an accumulation of glycogen, while the anaplastic component was devoid of evident clear cell changes. The case is one of exceedingly few descriptions of a ccPTC that dedifferentiates to an ATC, suggesting that this PTC subtype is not without potential for development of a highly lethal tumor component. Moreover, the partial lack of response to neoadjuvant therapy suggests a possible underlying resistance to aggressive treatment modalities in this particular case.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\30931661.txt,1,"Clear cell change is a rare observation in thyroid cancer, resulting from aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of lipids, glycogen, or thyroglobulin in the tumor cells.

Gene mutation analysis is recommended for the evaluation of thyroid nodules using clinical guidelines. The detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has the potential to aid in the screening, diagnosis and prediction of thyroid cancer prognosis, and can be used when tissues are difficult to obtain. In the present study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on tumors and matched normal tissues from 10 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in Quanzhou, China. Hotspot mutations in tumor DNA and cell-free DNA were identified in the validation cohort, which included 59 patients with PTC. BRAF V600E occurred in five samples, and was the most frequent mutation observed. Variation allele frequency (VAF) of BRAF V600E detected by WES was positively correlated with VAF determined using digital PCR (R2=0.9197; P=0.0099). A number of novel mutated genes were identified, including zinc finger protein 717, pleckstrin homology like domain family A member 1, RBMX like 3, lysine methyltransferase 5A and trichohyalin, along with the reported genes BRAF, NRAS and mucin 16, cell surface associated. Somatic mutated genes were enriched in the 'focal adhesion' pathway, as determined by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes or Gene Ontology analysis. In the validation cohort, 44.07% of tumors were BRAF V600E-positive, and the sensitivity and specificity of BRAF V600E ctDNA were 61.54 and 90.91%, respectively.

31216739,PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome: A Clinical Overview.,"The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) is a grouping of related genetic disorders that has been linked to germline mutations in the PTEN gene. These disorders include Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, adult Lhermitte-Duclos disease, and autism spectrum disorders associated with macrocephaly. The majority of the clinical information available on PHTS, however, is related to individuals diagnosed with CS. There is still much to be learned about this disorder, since diagnostic criteria for CS were only established in 1996, before the identification of the PTEN gene, and were based primarily on features seen in cases reported in the existing literature. More recently, however, data from several large series of patients have shown that a number of the clinical features associated with PTEN mutations are either more or less common than previously reported. In addition, we now know that only about 30-35% of patients meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome actually have a detectable PTEN mutation. Thus, our understanding of PTEN-related diseases and their management has evolved significantly over time. The United States National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has produced and regularly updates practice guidelines which include clinical diagnostic criteria as well as guidelines for PTEN testing and management of patients with mutations.

These data indicate the necessity of new screening methods that are more comfortable for patients, hence the compliance can be increased. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) level in blood is elevated in certain physiological conditions, such as pregnancy or high physical activity. Furthermore, cfDNA concentration alterations can also be detected in some pathological processes; increased cfDNA amount was observed in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as in various cancers including CRC. Numerous studies about origin, function, and mechanism of cfDNA can be found in the scientific literature. In this review, we aimed to describe the quantitative and qualitative changes of cfDNA, to present its functions, and to provide an overview of the available diagnostic applications for CRC. CfDNA can be released to the circulatory system via apoptosis, necrosis or by direct secretions by living cells. In cancer patients, cfDNA can originate from healthy and cancer cells, hence genetic (e.g. mutations in APC, KRAS, BRAF) and epigenetic (e.g. methylation in SEPT9, SFRP1) alterations of tumor cells can be examined in cfDNA fraction. Several high-throughput, sensitive and even automated methods are available providing opportunity to perform standardized sample preparation and to analyse biomarker candidates quantitatively.

30517645,"JUNO, the receptor of sperm IZUMO1, is expressed by the human oocyte and is essential for human fertilisation.","STUDY QUESTION: Is JUNO protein present at the surface membrane of human oocytes and involved in the fertilisation process? SUMMARY ANSWER: JUNO protein is expressed on the plasma membrane of human oocytes and its inhibition by a monoclonal antibody completely blocks gamete fusion. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fusion of gamete membranes is the culminating event of the fertilisation process, but its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Until now, three molecules have been shown to be essential: CD9 tetraspanin in the oocyte, Izumo1 protein on the sperm and Juno, its corresponding receptor on the oocyte. Oocyte CD9 and sperm IZUMO1 have been identified in human gametes and their interaction is also well-conserved among several mammalian species. The presence of JUNO on human oocytes, however, has not yet been reported, nor has its role in fertilisation been investigated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We selected an anti-human JUNO antibody in order to investigate the presence of JUNO on the oocyte membrane surface and studied its potential involvement in gamete membrane interaction during fertilisation. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies against human JUNO (anti-hJUNO mAb) were produced by immunisation of mice with HEK cells transfected with the putative human JUNO sequence (HEK-hJUNO). These antibodies were used for immunostaining experiments and in vitro fertilisation assays with human gametes (GERMETHEQUE Biobank). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Three hybridoma supernatants, verified by immunostaining, revealed specifically HEK-hJUNO cells. The three purified monoclonal antibodies, FJ2E4 (IgG1), FJ8E8 (IgG1) and FJ4F5 (IgG2a), recognised the soluble recombinant human JUNO protein and, in a western blot of HEK-hJUNO extracts, a protein with an expected MW of 25 kDa. In addition, soluble recombinant human IZUMO protein inhibited the binding of anti-hJUNO mAbs to cells expressing hJUNO. Using these anti-hJUNO mAbs in immunostaining, we identified the presence of JUNO protein at the plasma membrane of human oocytes. Furthermore, we revealed a progressive expression of JUNO according to oocyte maturity. Finally, we showed that human zona-free oocytes, inseminated in the presence of anti-hJUNO mAb, were not fertilised by human sperm. These results suggest that, as seen in the mouse, JUNO is indeed involved in human gamete membrane fusion during fertilisation. LARGE-SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: In accordance with French bioethics laws, functional tests were performed using zona-free oocytes, which of course does not fully encompass all normal in vivo physiological conditions. However, these in vitro tests do provide direct information regarding sperm-oocyte membrane interactions. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Mechanisms of gamete fusion appear to be homologous between mice and humans. However, some differences do exist and analysing the human mechanisms is essential.

30971541,The diagnostic significance of trophoblast cell-surface antigen-2 expression in benign and malignant thyroid lesions.,"CONTEXT: Thyroid cancers are the most common malignancy of the endocrine system. Over-expression of trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP-2) in various tumors has been found to correlate with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluateTROP-2 expression in thyroid neoplasms. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study contained 152 cases, including 48 follicular nodular disease (FND), 29 follicular adenoma (FA), 57 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 12 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), 3 medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 2 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and 1 undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UDTC). TROP-2 expression was investigated via immunohistochemistry in sections prepared from paraffin blocks of the cases. RESULTS: The cases comprised 32 (21%) males and 120 (79%) females with a mean age of 46.8 years (range, 15-85 years). TROP-2 expression was observed in 74.6% of the malignant lesions of the thyroid except for medullary carcinoma, poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. Immunoreactivity was 3.4% in FA, 41.7% of cases with FTC and 81.8% in PTC follicular variant (PTC fv). The difference between FA/FTC and FA/PTC follicular variant were both significant (P < 0.005, P < 0.001, respectively). There was no difference between FTC/PTC fv (P = 0.089).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study contained 152 cases, including 48 follicular nodular disease (FND), 29 follicular adenoma (FA), 57 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 12 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), 3 medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 2 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and 1 undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UDTC). TROP-2 expression was investigated via immunohistochemistry in sections prepared from paraffin blocks of the cases. RESULTS: The cases comprised 32 (21) males and 120 (79) females with a mean age of 46.8 years (range, 15-85 years). TROP-2 expression was observed in 74.6 of the malignant lesions of the thyroid except for medullary carcinoma, poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. Immunoreactivity was 3.4 in FA, 41.7 of cases with FTC and 81.8 in PTC follicular variant (PTC fv). The difference between FAFTC and FAPTC follicular variant were both significant (P  0.005, P  0.001, respectively). There was no difference between FTCPTC fv (P  0.089). CONCLUSION: TROP-2 can be considered a useful marker for distinguishing PTC fv cases from follicular nodular disease and follicular adenoma cases because of its high sensitivity in the identification of papillary carcinomas of the thyroid.","['malignancy', 'tumor', 'carcinoma']",1

25123125,Metabolism and insulin signaling in common metabolic disorders and inherited insulin resistance.,"Type 2 diabetes, obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are common metabolic disorders which are observed with increasing prevalences, and which are caused by a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, including increased calorie intake and physical inactivity. These metabolic disorders are all characterized by reduced plasma adiponectin and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Quantitatively skeletal muscle is the major site of insulin resistance. Both low plasma adiponectin and insulin resistance contribute to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In several studies, we have investigated insulin action on glucose and lipid metabolism, and at the molecular level, insulin signaling to glucose transport and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle from healthy individuals and in obesity, PCOS and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, we have described a novel syndrome characterized by postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and insulin resistance. This syndrome is caused by a mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor gene (INSR). We have studied individuals with this mutation as a model of inherited insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes, obesity and PCOS are characterized by pronounced defects in the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, in particular glycogen synthesis and to a lesser extent glucose oxidation, and the ability of insulin to suppress lipid oxidation. In inherited insulin resistance, however, only insulin action on glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis is impaired. This suggests that the defects in glucose and lipid oxidation in the common metabolic disorders are secondary to other factors. In young women with PCOS, the degree of insulin resistance was similar to that seen in middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes. This supports the hypothesis of an unique pathogenesis of insulin resistance in PCOS. Insulin in physiological concentrations stimulates glucose uptake in human skeletal muscle in vivo by activation of the insulin signaling cascade to glucose transport through the enzymes IRS1, PI3K, Akt2, AS160/TBC1D4 and RAC1, and to glycogen synthesis through Akt2, inhibition of GSK3 and activation of glycogen synthase (GS) via dephosphorylation of serine residues in both the NH2-terminal (site 2+2a) and the COOH-terminal end (site 3a+3b). In type 2 diabetes, obesity and PCOS, there is, although with some variation from study to study, defects in insulin signaling through IRS1, PI3K, Akt2 and AS160/TBC1D4, which can explain reduced insulin action on glucose transport. In type 2 diabetes an altered intracellular distribution of SNAP23 and impaired activation of RAC1 also seem to play a role for reduced insulin action on glucose transport. In all common metabolic disorders, we observed an impaired insulin activation of GS, which seems to be caused by attenuated dephosphorylation of GS at site 2+2a, whereas as the inhibition of GSK3 and the dephosphorylation of GS at its target sites, site 3a+3a, appeared to be completely normal. In individuals with inherited insulin resistance, we observed largely the same defects in insulin action on IRS1, PI3K, Akt2 and GS, as well as a normal inhibition of GSK3 and dephosphorylation of GS at site 3a+3b. In these individuals, however, a markedly reduced insulin clearance seems to partially rescue insulin signaling to glucose transport and GS. Adiponectin is thought to improve insulin sensitivity primarily by increasing lipid oxidation through activation of the enzyme AMPK, and possibly via cross-talking of adiponectin with insulin signaling, and hence glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. We demonstrated a strong correlation between plasma adiponectin and insulin action on glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis in obesity, type 2 diabetes and PCOS. In individuals with inherited insulin resistance, plasma adiponectin was normal, but the correlation of adiponectin with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis was at least equally strong. Moreover, we found a correlation between plasma adiponectin and insulin activation of GS. This result is supported by a number of recent studies of animal models and muscle cell lines, which have shown that adiponectin augments insulin action on enzymes in the insulin signaling cascade. In contrast, we observed no differences in the abundance or activity of AMPK in obesity, type 2 diabetes, PCOS or inherited insulin resistance. This indicates that reduced insulin sensitivity in these conditions is not mediated via abnormal AMPK activity. The results from these studies demonstrate that the well-established abnormalities in insulin action on glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis are reflected by defects in insulin signaling to these cellular processes in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and PCOS, and as expected also in inherited insulin resistance caused by a mutation in INSR. In common metabolic disorders, low plasma adiponectin may contribute to insulin resistance and defects in insulin signaling, whereas in inherited insulin resistance a normal plasma adiponectin and reduced insulin clearance could contribute to maintain a sufficient activation of the insulin signaling cascade. The insight gained from these studies have improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of humans, and can form the basis for further studies, which can lead to the development of treatment that more directly targets insulin resistance, and hence reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25123125.txt,0,"Type 2 diabetes, obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are common metabolic disorders which are observed with increasing prevalences, and which are caused by a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, including increased calorie intake and physical inactivity.

31292797,Lynch syndrome with exclusive skin involvement: time to consider a molecular definition?,"Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is clinically characterized by the occurrence of skin, usually sebaceous, and visceral tumors in the same individual. The most common underlying mechanism is a constitutional defect of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes that cause Lynch syndrome (LS). Herewithin we report on a 76 years-old male patient heterozygous for a pathogenic MSH2 missense substitution who presented with a striking cutaneous phenotype in the absence of typical LS visceral tumors. The patient developed 20 skin tumors, including sebaceous adenomas/carcinomas and keratoacanthomas. Two skin tumors showed immunohistochemical loss of MSH2 and MSH6 expression. There was no apparent family history of neoplasia. Based on the variable involvement of the skin and internal organs, we suggest that the definition of tumor associations that are often observed as variants of inherited tumor syndromes, such as MTS, should be guided by the underlying molecular bases. In addition, the presence of multiple sebaceous tumors, especially if showing MMR deficiency, appears to be a very strong indicator of a constitutional MMR gene defect.

This study assessed the DPD testing implementation status in Europe before (2019) and after (2021) the release of the EMA recommendations.
The survey was conducted from 16 March 2022 to 31 July 2022. An electronic form with seven closed and three open questions was e-mailed to 251 professionals with DPD testing expertise of 34 European countries. A descriptive analysis was conducted.
We received 79 responses (31%) from 23 countries. Following publication of the EMA recommendations, 87% and 75% of the countries reported an increase in the amount of genotype and phenotype testing, respectively. Implementation of novel local guidelines was reported by 21 responders (27%). Countries reporting reimbursement of both tests increased in 2021, and only four (18%) countries reported no coverage for any testing type. In 2019, major implementation drivers were 'retrospective assessment of fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity' (39%), and in 2021, testing was driven by 'publication of guidelines' (40%).

25246557,Bimodal activation of BubR1 by Bub3 sustains mitotic checkpoint signaling.,"The mitotic checkpoint (also known as the spindle assembly checkpoint) prevents premature anaphase onset through generation of an inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C, whose ubiquitination of cyclin B and securin targets them for degradation. Combining in vitro reconstitution and cell-based assays, we now identify dual mechanisms through which Bub3 promotes mitotic checkpoint signaling. Bub3 enhances signaling at unattached kinetochores not only by facilitating binding of BubR1 but also by enhancing Cdc20 recruitment to kinetochores mediated by BubR1's internal Cdc20 binding site. Downstream of kinetochore-produced complexes, Bub3 promotes binding of BubR1's conserved, amino terminal Cdc20 binding domain to a site in Cdc20 that becomes exposed by initial Mad2 binding. This latter Bub3-stimulated event generates the final mitotic checkpoint complex of Bub3-BubR1-Cdc20 that selectively inhibits ubiquitination of securin and cyclin B by APC/C(Cdc20). Thus, Bub3 promotes two distinct BubR1-Cdc20 interactions, involving each of the two Cdc20 binding sites of BubR1 and acting at unattached kinetochores or cytoplasmically, respectively, to facilitate production of the mitotic checkpoint inhibitor.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25246557.txt,0,"The mitotic checkpoint (also known as the spindle assembly checkpoint) prevents premature anaphase onset through generation of an inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase APCC, whose ubiquitination of cyclin B and securin targets them for degradation.

Downstream of kinetochore-produced complexes, Bub3 promotes binding of BubR1s conserved, amino terminal Cdc20 binding domain to a site in Cdc20 that becomes exposed by initial Mad2 binding. This latter Bub3-stimulated event generates the final mitotic checkpoint complex of Bub3-BubR1-Cdc20 that selectively inhibits ubiquitination of securin and cyclin B by APCC(Cdc20). Thus, Bub3 promotes two distinct BubR1-Cdc20 interactions, involving each of the two Cdc20 binding sites of BubR1 and acting at unattached kinetochores or cytoplasmically, respectively, to facilitate production of the mitotic checkpoint inhibitor.",[],0
31278395,The Cancer Genome Atlas of renal cell carcinoma: findings and clinical implications.,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) characterized the somatic genetic and genomic alterations in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) encompassing the major RCC histological subtypes, including clear cell RCC (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC) and chromophobe RCC (chRCC). Unique distinguishing features were found between the RCC subtypes, including in chromosomal alterations and tumour metabolism, as well as within each RCC subtype, of which some correlated with differences in patient survival. Two new RCC subtypes were defined by distinct epigenetic and metabolic pathway expression patterns, the hypermethylated CpG island methylator phenotype-associated (CIMP) RCCs and metabolically divergent chRCCs, and new biomarkers of poor patient outcome were identified, including PBRM1 mutation in type 1 pRCC and CDKN2A loss in chRCC. Expression of many immune cell gene-specific signatures was increased in ccRCC compared with pRCC and chRCC, and expression of select signatures, including the type 2 T helper cell signature, was increased in CIMP RCC. Increased expression of the type 2 T helper cell signature correlated with poorer survival in ccRCC, pRCC and chRCC.

OBJECTIVE: We searched for ARMC5 mutations in a large cohort of patients with MAH. The clinical phenotype of patients with and without ARMC5 mutations was compared. METHODS: Blood DNA from 34 MAH patients was genotyped using Sanger sequencing. Diurnal serum cortisol measurements, plasma ACTH levels, urinary steroids, 6-day Liddle's test, adrenal computed tomography, and weight of adrenal glands at adrenalectomy were assessed. RESULTS: Germline ARMC5 mutations were found in 15 of 34 patients (44.1%). In silico analysis of the mutations indicated that seven (20.6%) predicted major implications for gene function. Late-night cortisol levels were higher in patients with ARMC5-damaging mutations compared with those without and/or with nonpathogenic mutations (14.5 +- 5.6 vs 6.7 +- 4.3, P < .001). All patients carrying a pathogenic ARMC5 mutation had clinical Cushing's syndrome (seven of seven, 100%) compared with 14 of 27 (52%) of those without or with mutations that were predicted to be benign (P = .029). Repeated-measures analysis showed overall higher urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and free cortisol values in the patients with ARMC5-damaging mutations during the 6-day Liddle's test (P = .0002).

29781571,New approach to accurate interpretation of sickle cell disease newborn screening by applying multiple of median cutoffs and ratios.,"BACKGROUND: The main goal of newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease (SCD) is to detect affected neonates so that specific preventive care can be implemented. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) used for NBS has high sensitivity and specificity, but we lack guidelines for quantitative hemoglobin (Hb) fraction interpretation. The purpose of this study was to determine cutoff values to standardize quantitative interpretation in SCD NBS for different clinical situation such as, red blood cell transfusion or beta-thalassemia, which can be real screening pitfalls. METHODS: Retrospective study of 75,026 samples from the neonatal screening program analyzed in our laboratory. Precise HbA and HbS percentages at birth were recorded and median values established for each gestational age, allowing percentage results to be expressed in normal gestation-specific multiples of the median (MoM). Three threshold values of clinical interest were determined. RESULTS: High levels of HbA (>2.5 MoM) allowed identification of newborns who received transfusions. Low levels of HbS (<=0.7 MoM) allowed detection of the association between HbS and other mutations of the beta-globin gene (i.e., HbHope, beta0-thalassemia, etc.). An HbA/HbS ratio <0.5 to distinguish healthy carriers from SCD with S/beta+-thalassemia. The screening accuracy for each threshold was established. The screening accuracy of low-level HbA, which is determinant in identifying the subgroup of patients at risk of beta-thalassemia, will be determined prospectively.

37460897,Mechanistic and evolutionary insights into a type V-M CRISPR-Cas effector enzyme.,"RNA-guided type V CRISPR-Cas12 effectors provide adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in bacteria and archaea. Among diverse Cas12 enzymes, the recently identified Cas12m2 (CRISPR-Cas type V-M) is highly compact and has a unique RuvC active site. Although the non-canonical RuvC triad does not permit dsDNA cleavage, Cas12m2 still protects against invading MGEs through transcriptional silencing by strong DNA binding. However, the molecular mechanism of RNA-guided genome inactivation by Cas12m2 remains unknown. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of two states of Cas12m2-CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-target DNA ternary complexes and the Cas12m2-crRNA binary complex, revealing structural dynamics during crRNA-target DNA heteroduplex formation. The structures indicate that the non-target DNA strand is tightly bound to a unique arginine-rich cluster in the recognition (REC) domains and the non-canonical active site in the RuvC domain, ensuring strong DNA-binding affinity of Cas12m2. Furthermore, a structural comparison of Cas12m2 with TnpB, a putative ancestor of Cas12 enzymes, suggests that the interaction of the characteristic coiled-coil REC2 insertion with the protospacer-adjacent motif-distal region of the heteroduplex is crucial for Cas12m2 to engage in adaptive immunity.

METHODS: We collected data from a nationwide-registry of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) in Spain. We identified patients whose colorectal tumors had loss of MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, or MLH1 (based on immunohistochemistry), without the mutation encoding V600E in BRAF (detected by real-time PCR), and/or no methylation at MLH1 (determined by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification), and no pathogenic mutations in MMR genes, BRAF, or EPCAM (determined by DNA sequencing). These patients were considered to have LLS. We collected data on demographic, clinical, and pathology features and family history of neoplasms. The chi2 test was used to analyze the association between qualitative variables, followed by the Fisher exact test and the Student t test or the Mann-Whitney test for quantitative variables. RESULTS: We identified 160 patients with LLS; their mean age at diagnosis of CRC was 55 years and 66 patients were female (41%).

The p53 is frequently expressed in CRC and its association with clinicopathological features is still controversial. Moreover, accumulated evidence suggests that both p53 and nuclear exporter protein, exportin 1 (XPO1), are working in reciprocal manner may lead to loss of p53 nuclear localization and enhance cancer progression through hyperactive nuclear export. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate the expression of p53 in CRC Yemeni patients and to explore the association between the p53 and XPO1 coexpression in relation to clinicopathological features. METHODS: A series of 40 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks taken from CRC patients that diagnosed as adenocarcinoma were prospectively collected and then analyzed for p53 and XPO1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The patients and tumor clinicopathological characteristics were retrieved from the histopathology reports and the P value <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The p53 expression was observed in 60% (24/40) of CRC tumor samples. Significantly, the p53 expression was noted in 72.4% (21/29) of the left side compared to 27.3% (3/11) of the right side colon tumors (P=0.014). Furthermore, p53 expression was positively and significantly correlated with well-but not moderate- or poorly-differentiated tumors (P=0.023).

25174872,IL-10/Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling dysregulates Bim expression in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a human disorder of T cell homeostasis caused by mutations that impair FAS-mediated apoptosis. A defining characteristic of ALPS is the expansion of double negative T cells (DNTC). Relatively little is known about how defective FAS-driven cell death and the Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway intersect in ALPS patients. OBJECTIVE: We studied changes in Bcl-2 family member expression in ALPS to determine whether the Bcl-2 pathway might provide a therapeutic target. METHODS: We used flow cytometry to analyze the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in T cells from 12 ALPS patients and determined the in vitro sensitivity of ALPS DNTC to the pro-apoptotic BH3 mimetic, ABT-737. RESULTS: The pro-apoptotic molecule, Bim, was significantly elevated in DNTC. Although no general pattern of individual anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members emerged, increased expression of Bim was always accompanied by increased expression of at least 1 anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member. Strikingly, Bim levels in DNTC correlated significantly with serum IL-10 in ALPS patients, and IL-10 was sufficient to mildly induce Bim in normal and ALPS T cells via a Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-dependent mechanism. Finally, ABT-737 preferentially killed ALPS DNTC in vitro. CONCLUSION: Combined, these data show that an IL-10/Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway drives Bim expression in ALPS DNTC, which renders them sensitive to BH3 mimetics, uncovering a potentially novel therapeutic approach to ALPS.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25174872.txt,0,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a human disorder of T cell homeostasis caused by mutations that impair FAS-mediated apoptosis.

METHODS: We used flow cytometry to analyze the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in T cells from 12 ALPS patients and determined the in vitro sensitivity of ALPS DNTC to the pro-apoptotic BH3 mimetic, ABT-737. RESULTS: The pro-apoptotic molecule, Bim, was significantly elevated in DNTC. Although no general pattern of individual anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members emerged, increased expression of Bim was always accompanied by increased expression of at least 1 anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member. Strikingly, Bim levels in DNTC correlated significantly with serum IL-10 in ALPS patients, and IL-10 was sufficient to mildly induce Bim in normal and ALPS T cells via a Janus kinasesignal transducer and activator of transcription 3-dependent mechanism. Finally, ABT-737 preferentially killed ALPS DNTC in vitro. CONCLUSION: Combined, these data show that an IL-10Janus kinasesignal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway drives Bim expression in ALPS DNTC, which renders them sensitive to BH3 mimetics, uncovering a potentially novel therapeutic approach to ALPS.",[],0
38281420,Automatic detection of myocardial ischaemia using generalisable spatio-temporal hierarchical Bayesian modelling of DCE-MRI.,"Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) can be used as a non-invasive method for the assessment of myocardial perfusion. The acquired images can be utilised to analyse the spatial extent and severity of myocardial ischaemia (regions with impaired microvascular blood flow). In the present paper, we propose a novel generalisable spatio-temporal hierarchical Bayesian model (GST-HBM) to automate the detection of ischaemic lesions and improve the in silico prediction accuracy by systematically integrating spatio-temporal context information. We present a computational inference procedure with an adequate trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, whereby model parameters are sampled from the posterior distribution with Gibbs sampling, while lower-level hyperparameters are selected using model selection strategies based on the Watanabe Akaike information criterion (WAIC). We have assessed our method on both synthetic (in silico) data with known gold-standard and 12 sets of clinical first-pass myocardial perfusion DCE-MRI datasets. We have also carried out a comparative performance evaluation with four established alternative methods: Gaussian mixture model (GMM), opening and closing operations based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM<sub>C&O</sub><sup>max</sup>), Markov random field constrained Gaussian mixture model (GMM-MRF) and model-based hierarchical Bayesian model (M-HBM). Our results show that the proposed GST-HBM method achieves much higher in silico prediction accuracy than the established alternative methods.

METHODS: All SNPs were genotyped in 226 adult AML cases and 406 healthy individuals. AML patients were investigated for FLT3 (ITD, D835), DNMT3A (R882), and NPM1 type A mutations. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that age above 65 years had a negative influence on survival (P < .001). The presence of the rs1800750 variant genotype (P = .005) or FLT3-ITD mutation (P = .009) in a cytogenetic high-risk group (P = .003) negatively influenced OS. A negative association was observed between Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group Scale status > 2, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, platelet (PLT) count <40 000 cells/mm3 , and OS.

We have reviewed presentation of sporadic paediatric NF2 to raise awareness of early features, highlighting those requiring further investigation. DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with NF2 at age <=16 and seen between 2012 and 2015 were notified via the British Paediatric Neurology Surveillance Unit or identified through the English NF2 service. RESULTS: Epidemiological data estimate that 1 in 110 611 births are affected with childhood-onset NF2. Notes of 32 patients with sporadic NF2 were reviewed. Of those presenting under the age of 5, 89% (17/19) had ocular, 74% (14/19) dermatological and 58% (11/19) neurological signs; in 84% (16/19) features were multisystemic. Sixty-six per cent (21/32) had >=1 atypical feature, including cerebellar hypoplasia in three cases (9%) and focal cortical dysplasia in five out of seven seizure-related presentations. Five cases presented with a sometimes transient or intermittent cranial nerve mononeuropathy. The mean delay to diagnosis was 3.16 years; in eight cases (25%) this exceeded 6 years. Most significant delay occurred in mononeuropathy, ophthalmological and/or seizure presentations, with a mean delay of 3, 4.5 and 6 years, respectively. Eighty-four per cent (27/32) of cases needed intervention in childhood. CONCLUSIONS: All non-vestibular schwannoma NF2 presentations in childhood had significant diagnostic delay.

Targeting androgen receptor (AR) signaling by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the current therapeutic regime for patients newly diagnosed with metastatic PCa. However, most patients relapse and become resistant to ADT, leading to metastatic castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and eventually death. Several proposed mechanisms have been proposed for CRPC; however, the exact mechanism through which CRPC develops is still unclear. One possible pathway is that the AR remains active in CRPC cases.

Despite the current improved treatment modalities, there is still up to 50-60% local regional recurrence and or distant metastasis. High-resolution medical imaging technologies such as PET/CT and MRI do not currently detect the early spread of tumour cells, thus limiting the potential for effective minimal residual detection and early diagnosis. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are a rare subset of cells that escape from the primary tumour and enter into the bloodstream to form metastatic deposits or even re-establish themselves in the primary site of the cancer. These cells are more aggressive and accumulate gene alterations by somatic mutations that are the same or even greater than the primary tumour because of additional features acquired in the circulation. The potential application of CTC in clinical use is to acquire a liquid biopsy, by taking a reliable minimally invasive venous blood sample, for cell genotyping during radiotherapy treatment to monitor the decline in CTC detectability, and mutational changes in response to radiation resistance and radiation sensitivity. Currently, very little has been published on radiation therapy, CTC, and circulating cancer stem cells (CCSCs).

The primary CNS anaplastic variant of DLBCL (A-DLBCL) is even less common; to our knowledge, there are only two other case reports in the literature. The aim of this report is to present rare cases of primary CNS A-DLBCL and study their clinicopathologic and genetic features. CASE PRESENTATION: We report 3 patients, two men and one woman, aged 54, 55 and 67 years old, with primary CNS A-DLBCL. All 3 patients had a high International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) score; although the patients were treated with methotrexate-based regimens and/or with radiation therapy, the overall survival was only 2, 5, and 8 months. All 3 patients presented with characteristic features of perivascular space infiltration with bizarre-shaped tumor cells, leading to the diagnosis of primary CNS A-DLBCL. Concurrent of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 abnormalities and MYC/BCL2 double-expressor DLBCL occurred in all 3 patients; two patients had MYC/BCL2/BCL6 triple extra copies, and one patient had MYC extra copy and BCL6 translocation. All 3 patients displayed mutations in MYD88 L265P and nuclear positivity for RELA, RELB and/or c-Rel, indicating constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB pathway.

31248668,Molecular classification of endometrial carcinoma applied to endometrial biopsy specimens: Towards early personalized patient management.,"BACKGROUND: The current risk stratification systems used to guide management of endometrial cancer are based on irreproducible post surgical pathological information, hence the need for more reliable classification systems. Using microarray and sequencing technologies, TCGA recently identified four prognostically significant endometrial carcinoma subtypes, which subsequently proved reproducible using clinically applicable surrogate tests. Using these tests, we sought to determine the level of concordance between endometrial biopsies and subsequent hysterectomy specimens in assessing the molecular classification of endometrial carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty biopsies with corresponding hysterectomy specimens for endometrial carcinomas were collected. Additionally, 10 cases of biopsy proven atypical hyperplasia/EIN who were found to have endometrial carcinoma on resection were included. IHC for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6) and P53 was performed. Microsatellite instability analysis was performed by PCR and Sanger sequencing was performed to detect mutations in exons 9 and 13 of the POLE gene. The level of concordance for tumor grade, histologic subtype, immunohistochemical and molecular profile in both specimens was determined using Cohen's kappa estimates. RESULTS: A high level of concordance was achieved for MMR-loss, MSI-high, P53-wild and abnormal types. In contrast, grade and histologic subtype showed only moderate levels of agreement. POLE gene mutation was detected in two patients. For both cases, mutations were detected only in resection specimens. When comparing atypical hyperplasia/EIN with subsequent hysterectomy tumor, the profile was identical to that of endometrial carcinoma. CONCLUSION: In our cohort of endometrial carcinoma, a high level of concordance was achieved between biopsy and hysterectomy specimens for MMR-loss, MSI-high, P53-wild and abnormal types, superior to that of grade and histologic subtype, providing earlier and more reliable prognostic information to inform management.

30997549,[Pituitary adenomas].,"Despite characteristic symptoms the diagnosis of clinically relevant pituitary adenomas is often delayed until an advanced stage due to the rarity of the disease. The typical clinical manifestations are presented in this review article. The recent discovery of the USP8 mutation in Cushing's disease and of X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG) syndrome in early onset gigantism were milestones in the search for the molecular etiology of pituitary adenomas. The triad of endocrinological, radiological and ophthalmological diagnostics are the main pillars for the diagnostic work-up of pituitary adenomas. The standard treatment modalities, which include surgery, medical treatment and irradiation, have been further developed and refined. For transsphenoidal excision of pituitary adenomas, microsurgery and endoscopy are two equivalent surgical techniques with relatively few complications. Surgery represents the first-line treatment of pituitary adenomas. Prolactinomas are an exception as the medical treatment with dopamine agonists is highly efficient. Nowadays, new medical treatment options are available for acromegaly and Cushing's disease and are used for second-line treatment. The alkylating chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide is used for the first-line chemotherapy of rare aggressively growing pituitary adenomas. Irradiation is indicated if surgical and medical treatment options are insufficiently successful. Stereotactic one-stage irradiation (radiosurgery) is especially suitable for well-demarcated invasive residual or recurrent adenomas in the cavernous sinus.

25488918,BRCA2 diffuses as oligomeric clusters with RAD51 and changes mobility after DNA damage in live cells.,"Genome maintenance by homologous recombination depends on coordinating many proteins in time and space to assemble at DNA break sites. To understand this process, we followed the mobility of BRCA2, a critical recombination mediator, in live cells at the single-molecule level using both single-particle tracking and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. BRCA2-GFP and -YFP were compared to distinguish diffusion from fluorophore behavior. Diffusive behavior of fluorescent RAD51 and RAD54 was determined for comparison. All fluorescent proteins were expressed from endogenous loci. We found that nuclear BRCA2 existed in oligomeric clusters, and exhibited heterogeneous mobility. DNA damage increased BRCA2 transient binding, presumably including binding to damaged sites. Despite its very different size, RAD51 displayed mobility similar to BRCA2, which indicates physical interaction between these proteins both before and after induction of DNA damage. We propose that BRCA2-mediated sequestration of nuclear RAD51 serves to prevent inappropriate DNA interactions and that all RAD51 is delivered to DNA damage sites in association with BRCA2.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25488918.txt,0,"Genome maintenance by homologous recombination depends on coordinating many proteins in time and space to assemble at DNA break sites.

To estimate the concordance of DNA copy-number-alterations (CNAs), mutations, and actionable genetic alterations (AGAs) between paired samples, we performed whole-genome array-comparative-genomic-hybridization, and targeted-next-generation-sequencing on 14 clinical PBC-BM pairs. We found more CNAs, more mutations, and higher tumor mutational burden, and more AGAs in BM than in PBC; 92% of the pairs harbored at least one AGA in the BM not observed in the paired PBC. This concerned various therapeutic classes, including tyrosine-kinase-receptor-inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/ mammalian Target of Rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/MTOR)-inhibitors, poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-inhibitors, or cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-inhibitors.

Identification of APC pathogenic variants sites and the genotype-phenotype correlation are important for characterizing, monitoring, and treating members of affected families. The aim of this study was to correlate genotype-phenotype of Brazilian individuals carrying APC pathogenic germline variants and that have FAP. METHODS: The polyposis phenotype of 99 individuals from 35 families between July 2013 and December 2014 were prospectively evaluated based on the InSIGHT polyposis staging classification. Seven extra-colonic manifestations were assessed and the clinical manifestations correlated with the APC genotype. RESULTS: The age of the study participants ranged from 12 to 67 years (median of 29 years). Twenty-six APC pathogenic variants were identified. Fifty-five cases harbored nonsense pathogenic variants (55.6%). Frameshift alterations were noted in 39 cases (39.4%). Aberrant splicing was noted in 1 case (1%). Rearrangements were observed in 3 cases (3%). An association between nonsense variants and rearrangement was noted in 1 case (1%). The genotype-phenotype correlation analysis led the identification of classic FAP in 94 cases (94.9%). Profuse polyposis was identified in 5 cases (5.1%). Thirty-six cases were diagnosed with cancer of which 29 cases (80.6%) were colorectal cancer, 1 case (2.7%) was brain cancer, 4 cases (11.2%) were papillary thyroid cancer, and 2 cases (5.5%) were stomach cancer.

27013236,A POT1 mutation implicates defective telomere end fill-in and telomere truncations in Coats plus.,"Coats plus (CP) can be caused by mutations in the CTC1 component of CST, which promotes polymerase alpha (polalpha)/primase-dependent fill-in throughout the genome and at telomeres. The cellular pathology relating to CP has not been established. We identified a homozygous POT1 S322L substitution (POT1(CP)) in two siblings with CP. POT1(CP)induced a proliferative arrest that could be bypassed by telomerase. POT1(CP)was expressed at normal levels, bound TPP1 and telomeres, and blocked ATR signaling. POT1(CP)was defective in regulating telomerase, leading to telomere elongation rather than the telomere shortening observed in other telomeropathies. POT1(CP)was also defective in the maintenance of the telomeric C strand, causing extended 3' overhangs and stochastic telomere truncations that could be healed by telomerase. Consistent with shortening of the telomeric C strand, metaphase chromosomes showed loss of telomeres synthesized by leading strand DNA synthesis. We propose that CP is caused by a defect in POT1/CST-dependent telomere fill-in. We further propose that deficiency in the fill-in step generates truncated telomeres that halt proliferation in cells lacking telomerase, whereas, in tissues expressing telomerase (e.g., bone marrow), the truncations are healed. The proposed etiology can explain why CP presents with features distinct from those associated with telomerase defects (e.g., dyskeratosis congenita).",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\27013236.txt,0,"Coats plus (CP) can be caused by mutations in the CTC1 component of CST, which promotes polymerase alpha (polalpha)primase-dependent fill-in throughout the genome and at telomeres.

METHODS: Totals of 154 M. avium isolates and 35 Mycobacterium intracellulare isolates were obtained from treatment-naive patients with pulmonary MAC disease at the diagnosis of MAC infection at 8 hospitals in Japan. Their susceptibilities of moxifloxacin were determined by broth microdilution methods. Moxifloxacin-resistant isolates were examined for mutations of gyrA and gyrB. Variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR) assay was performed using 15 M. avium VNTR loci and 16 M. intracellulare VNTR loci. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin susceptibility was categorized as resistant and intermediate for 6.5% and 16.9%, respectively, of M. avium isolates and 8.6% and 17.1% of M. intracellulare isolates. Although the isolates of both species had amino acid substitutions of Thr 96 and Thr 522 at the sites corresponding to Ser 95 in the M. tuberculosis GyrA and Gly 520 in the M. tuberculosis GyrB, respectively, these substitutions were observed irrespective of susceptibility and did not confer resistance.

Inhibiting Abeta production and/or enhancing the clearance of Abeta to reduce its levels are still the effective therapeutic strategies pursued in anti-AD research.

Furthermore, both the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and the number of LC3-positive puncta were significantly decreased in Se-Met-treated cells, suggesting that Se-Met also promoted Abeta clearance by modulating the autophagy pathway.

We developed the SETER/PR index to measure gene expression microarray probe sets that were correlated with hormone receptors (ESR1 and PGR) and robust to preanalytical and analytical influences. We tested SETER/PR index in biopsies of metastastic HR+/HER2- breast cancer against the treatment outcomes in 140 patients. Then we customized the SETER/PR assay to measure 18 informative, 10 reference transcripts, and sequence the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ESR1 using droplet-based targeted RNAseq, and tested that in residual RNA from 53 patients.

28951259,Chimerism in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and its correlation with the clinical outcome.,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only hope to cure many inherited and acquired hematological disorders in children. Monitoring of chimerism helps to predict the post-transplantation events, with the intention to enhance the long-term disease free survival (DFS). The study aimed to investigate the importance of early chimerism detection to predict the clinical outcome following HSCT. The study included nine recipients (six beta-thalassemia and three severe aplastic anemia patients) and their 10/10 HLA identical sibling donors. Chimerism detection was performed by analysis of short tandem repeat (STR) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection and quantification of the relative amounts of donor and recipient cells present on day +28. Peripheral blood (PB) was the main stem cell source for HSC transplantation. Disease free survival (DFS) was 71.4% while overall survival was 85.7% for PBSC transplants at the median follow up period of 4years. The early detection of chimerism by PCR-STR analysis for children with beta-thalassemia and aplastic anemia correlated with the outcome of HSCT in 8 (88.8%) patients. Complete chimerism was associated with disease-free survival while mixed chimerism and autologous patterns were associated with poor prognosis.

29463272,Colonic perineurioma (benign fibroblastic polyp): case report and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal perineuriomas are uncommon benign mucosal-based proliferations of mesenchymal cells that express perineurial markers, often associated with colonic crypts displaying a serrated/hyperplastic architecture. The vast majority of cases arise distal to the splenic flexure and have been described as sessile polyps. Using molecular analysis, BRAF mutations have been demonstrated in the serrated crypt epithelium. We report a new case of perineurioma presenting as a pedunculated polyp in the transverse colon, with prominent hemosiderin deposits in the uninvolved lamina propria that separated the perineurial proliferation from the surface epithelium, a previously unreported histological finding. By using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated the presence of BRAF V600E mutated protein in the serrated crypt epithelium. In addition, a review of the literature on colorectal perineurioma is provided. CASE PRESENTATION: A 5 mm pedunculated polyp was removed from the transverse colon of a 42 year old man who presented with epigastric pain, weight loss and rectal bleeding. A proliferation of uniform plump spindled cells expanded the lamina propria and separated serrated colonic crypts. The epithelial component closely resembled microvesicular hyperplastic polyp. Immunohistochemical stains for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and collagen IV were positive in the stromal proliferation. A mutation-specific monoclonal antibody directed against BRAF V600E showed positive cytoplasmic staining in the serrated crypt epithelium but not in the perineurial proliferation. Conspicuous hemosiderin deposition was seen in the inflamed lamina propria between the perineurial proliferation and the surface epithelium. CONCLUSION: Although the majority of colorectal perineuriomas occur in the sigmoid colon and rectum and are described as sessile polyps, colorectal perineurioma can present as a pedunculated polyp proximal to the splenic flexure as described in this case. Conspicuous hemosiderin deposition can be seen in the superficial lamina propria.

Here, we investigated the specific targeting and dynamics of histone H3 variants in human primary senescent cells. We show that newly synthesized epitope-tagged H3.3 is incorporated in senescent cells but does not accumulate in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF). Instead, we observe that new H3.3 colocalizes with its specific histone chaperones within the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and is targeted to PML-NBs in a DAXX-dependent manner both in proliferating and senescent cells. We further show that overexpression of DAXX enhances targeting of H3.3 in large PML-NBs devoid of transcriptional activity and promotes the accumulation of HP1, independently of H3K9me3. Loss of H3.3 from pericentromeric heterochromatin upon DAXX or PML depletion suggests that the targeting of H3.3 to PML-NBs is implicated in pericentromeric heterochromatin organization. Together, our results underline the importance of the replication-independent chromatin assembly pathway for histone replacement in non-dividing senescent cells and establish PML-NBs as important regulatory sites for the incorporation of new H3.3 into chromatin.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\24200965.txt,0,"Oncogene-induced senescence is a permanent cell cycle arrest characterized by extensive chromatin reorganization.

29973720,Mechanism for remodelling of the cell cycle checkpoint protein MAD2 by the ATPase TRIP13.,"The maintenance of genome stability during mitosis is coordinated by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) through its effector the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), an inhibitor of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C, also known as the cyclosome)1,2. Unattached kinetochores control MCC assembly by catalysing a change in the topology of the beta-sheet of MAD2 (an MCC subunit), thereby generating the active closed MAD2 (C-MAD2) conformer3-5. Disassembly of free MCC, which is required for SAC inactivation and chromosome segregation, is an ATP-dependent process driven by the AAA+ ATPase TRIP13. In combination with p31comet, an SAC antagonist6, TRIP13 remodels C-MAD2 into inactive open MAD2 (O-MAD2)7-10. Here, we present a mechanism that explains how TRIP13-p31comet disassembles the MCC. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the TRIP13-p31comet-C-MAD2-CDC20 complex reveal that p31comet recruits C-MAD2 to a defined site on the TRIP13 hexameric ring, positioning the N terminus of C-MAD2 (MAD2NT) to insert into the axial pore of TRIP13 and distorting the TRIP13 ring to initiate remodelling. Molecular modelling suggests that by gripping MAD2NT within its axial pore, TRIP13 couples sequential ATP-driven translocation of its hexameric ring along MAD2NT to push upwards on, and simultaneously rotate, the globular domains of the p31comet-C-MAD2 complex. This unwinds a region of the alphaA helix of C-MAD2 that is required to stabilize the C-MAD2 beta-sheet, thus destabilizing C-MAD2 in favour of O-MAD2 and dissociating MAD2 from p31comet.

CALR mutations account for approximately 30% of cases of essential thrombocythemia. In a retrospective study, we examined the frequency of MPL and CALR mutations in JAK2 V617F-negative cases of essential thrombocythemia (n=103). In addition, we compared the clinical phenotype and outcome of CALR mutant cases of essential thrombocythemia with a cohort of JAK2 V617F-positive essential thrombocythemia (n=57). CALR-positive cases represented 63.7% of double-negative cases of essential thrombocythemia, and most carried CALR type 1 or type 2 indels. However, we also identified one patient who was positive for both the JAK2 V617F and the CALR mutations.

31013001,Clinical impact of testing for mutations and microRNAs in thyroid nodules.,"BACKGROUND: We report results of a multicenter clinical experience study examining the likelihood of patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules to undergo surgery or have malignant outcome based on multiplatform combination mutation and microRNA testing (MPT). METHODS: MPT assessed mutations in BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA genes, PAX8/PPARgamma, RET/PTC1, and RET/PTC3 gene rearrangements, and the expression of 10 microRNAs. Baseline clinical information at the time of MPT and clinical follow-up records were reviewed for 337 patients, of which 80% had negative MPT results. Kaplan Meier analysis for cumulative probability of survival without having a surgical procedure or malignant diagnosis over the course of patient follow-up was determined for MPT results of 180 patients, among which only 14% had malignancy. RESULTS: A negative MPT result in nodules with Bethesda III or IV cytology (2009) conferred a high probability of non-surgical treatment, with only 11% expected to undergo surgery and a high probability of survival without malignancy (92%) for up to 2 years follow up. A positive MPT result conferred a 57% probability of malignancy and was an independent risk factor for undergoing surgical treatment (Hazard Ratio [HR] 9.2, 95% confidence intervals 5.4-15.9, P < .0001) and for malignancy (HR 13.4, 95% confidence intervals 4.8-37.2, P < .0001).

Twenty-six samples of normal control urothelium obtained from patients without urothelial carcinomas (C), 47 samples of non-cancerous urothelium without noticeable morphological changes obtained from patients with urothelial carcinomas (N), and 46 samples of the corresponding cancerous tissue (T) in the learning cohort and 64 N samples in the validation cohort, i.e. 183 tissue samples in total, were analyzed. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip, and DNA methylation levels were verified using pyrosequencing and MassARRAY. Amplicon sequencing was performed using the GeneRead DNAseq Targeted Panels V2. Although N samples rarely showed genetic mutations or copy number alterations, they showed DNA methylation alterations at 2502 CpG sites compared to C samples, and such alterations were inherited by or strengthened in T samples, indicating that DNA methylation alterations may participate in field cancerization in the urothelium. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis confirmed the feasibility of cancer risk estimation to identify urothelium at the precancerous stage by DNA methylation quantification. Cancer risk estimation permutation was established using a combination of two marker CpG loci on the HOXC4, TENM3 and TLR1 genes (sensitivity and specificity 96-100%). Among them, the diagnostic impact of 10 patterns of permutation was successfully validated in the validation cohort (sensitivity and specificity 94-98%).

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis confirmed the feasibility of cancer risk estimation to identify urothelium at the precancerous stage by DNA methylation quantification. Cancer risk estimation permutation was established using a combination of two marker CpG loci on the HOXC4, TENM3 and TLR1 genes (sensitivity and specificity 96-100). Among them, the diagnostic impact of 10 patterns of permutation was successfully validated in the validation cohort (sensitivity and specificity 94-98). These data suggest that cancer risk estimation using procedures such as urine tests during health checkups might become applicable for clinical use.",['cancer'],1
36621911,Diagnosis and management of parathyroid carcinoma: a state-of-the-art review.,"Parathyroid carcinoma is one of the least common endocrine malignancies and accounts for approximately 1% of all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature published between January 2000 and March 2022 via Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EudraCT, ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL and SCOPUS was conducted. Manuscripts were eligible if they included data on adult non-pregnant populations with parathyroid carcinoma. No restrictions regarding interventions, comparators or duration of follow-up were imposed. Single case reports, reviews or meta-analyses were excluded. Outcomes of interest were molecular pathogenesis, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and overall survival. Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. This review included 75 studies from 17 countries, reporting on more than 3000 patients with parathyroid carcinoma. CDC73 mutation has been recognised as playing a pivotal role in molecular pathogenesis. Parathyroid carcinoma typically presents with markedly increased calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The most frequently described symptoms were bone and muscle pain or weakness. En bloc resection remains the gold standard for the surgical approach.

36764880,Clinical utility of axillary nodal markers in breast cancer.,"De-escalation of axillary surgery for lymph node (LN) positive breast cancer is facilitated by marking involved nodes which, when removed with sentinel nodes constitute risk-adapted targeted axillary dissection (TAD). Whether after chemotherapy or for primary surgery, selected patients with biopsy-proven involvement of nodes may be eligible for axillary conservation. Likewise, impalpable recurrence or stage 4 patients with localised axillary disease may benefit. In these contexts, several devices are used to mark biopsied nodes to facilitate their accurate surgical removal. We report our experience using the paramagnetic MAGSEED (Endomag®, Cambridge, UK).
Local approval (BR2021_149) was obtained to interrogate a prospective database of all axillary markers. The primary endpoint was successful removal of the marked LN.
Of 241 markers (in 221 patients) inserted between October 2018 and July 2022, all were retrieved. Of 74 patients who had Magseeds® inserted after completion of NACT (involved nodes initially marked using an UltraCor™Twirl™ marker), the Magseeds® were found outside the node in neighbouring axillary tissue in 18 (24.3%) patients. When Magseeds® were placed at commencement of NACT in 54 patients, in only 1 (1.8%) was the marker found outside the node - a statistically significantly lower rate (Chi<sup>2</sup> 10.7581 p = 0.001038). For 'primary TAD' patients and those localised for recurrent or stage IV disease, all 93 had the Magseed® found within the biopsied node.

She presented with a jaw mass, bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, and immunoglobulin (Ig) assays of 20, 3.3 and 1.7-fold above maximum normal level for age of IgE, IgA and IgG, respectively, along with a low IgM, eosinophilia and lymphopenia.

24744588,HLA variants related to primary sclerosing cholangitis influence rejection after liver transplantation.,"AIM: To investigate influence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer immunoglobuline-like receptor (KIR) genotypes on risks of acute rejection (AR) after liver transplantation (LTX). METHODS: In this retrospective study we included 143 adult donor-recipient pairs with a minimum of 6 mo follow-up after LTX for whom DNA was available from both donor and recipients. Clinical data, all early complications including episodes and severity of AR and graft/patient survival were registered. The diagnosis of AR was based on clinical, biochemical and histological criteria. All suspected episodes of AR were biopsy confirmed. Key classical HLA loci (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DRB1) were genotyped using Sanger sequencing. 16 KIR genes were genotyped using a novel real time PCR approach which allows for determination of the diploid copy number of each KIR gene. Immunohistochemical staining for T (CD3), B (CD20) and natural killer (NK) cells (CD56 and CD57) were performed on liver biopsies from 3 different patient groups [primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cirrhosis and non-autoimmune liver disease], 10 in each group, with similar grade of AR. RESULTS: Fourty-four (31%) patients were transplanted on the basis of PSC, 40% of them had AR vs 24% in the non-PSC group (P = 0.04). No significant impact of donor-recipient matching for HLA and KIR genotypes was detected. In the overall recipient population an increased risk of AR was detected for HLA-B*08 (P = 0.002, OR = 2.5; 95%CI: 1.4-4.6), HLA-C*07 (P = 0.001, OR = 2.4; 95%CI: 1.4-4.0) and HLA-DRB1*03 (P = 0.03, OR = 1.9; 95%CI: 1.0-3.3) and a decreased risk for HLA-DRB1*04 (P = 0.001, OR = 0.2; 95%CI: 0.1-0.5). For HLA-B*08, HLA-C*07 and DRB1*04 the associations remained evident in a subgroup analysis of non-PSC recipients (P = 0.04, P = 0.003 and P = 0.02, respectively). In PSC recipients corresponding P values were 0.002, 0.17 and 0.01 for HLA-B*08, HLA-C*07 and DRB1*04, respectively.

Several mutations have been identified, yet the full mutational spectrum, and their phenotypic consequences, will require genotyping across different populations. To this end, we undertook the first detailed genotype and phenotype characterization of DMD in the Bangladeshi population. We investigated the rare mutational and phenotypic spectrum of the DMD gene in 36 DMD-suspected Bangladeshi participants using an economically affordable diagnostic strategy involving initial screening for exonic deletions in the DMD gene via multiplex PCR, followed by testing PCR-negative patients for mutations using whole exome sequencing. The deletion mapping identified two critical DMD gene hotspot regions (near proximal and distal ends, spanning exons 8-17 and exons 45-53, respectively) that comprised 95% (21/22) of the deletions for this population cohort. From our exome analysis, we detected two novel pathogenic hemizygous mutations in exons 21 and 42 of the DMD gene, and novel pathogenic recessive and loss of function variants in four additional genes: SGCD, DYSF, COL6A3, and DOK7. Our phenotypic analysis showed that DMD suspected participants presented diverse phenotypes according to the location of the mutation and which gene was impacted.

This study aimed to determine if it is preferable to add upfront cranial radiotherapy to EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with newly diagnosed brain metastases. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with CNS metastases who received EGFR-TKIs as a first-line therapy. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were enrolled and 39 patients received upfront brain radiotherapy, while 65 patients received first and second generation EGFR-TKIs first. The median time to treatment failure (TTF) was 7.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.3-9.4). The median survival time (MST) was 24.0 months (95% CI: 20.1-30.1). The overall response rate of the CNS was 37%. The median CNS progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.2 months (95% CI: 10.0-16.2). Brain radiotherapy prior to EGFR-TKI prolonged TTF (11.2 vs. 6.8 months, P = 0.038) and tended to prolong CNS-PFS (15.6 vs. 11.1 months, P = 0.096) but was not significantly associated with overall survival (MST 26.1 vs. 24.0 months, P = 0.525).

Overall survival was higher after HCT from matched-sibling donors (MSDs). Among recipients of non-MSD HCT, multivariate analysis showed that the SCID genotype strongly influenced survival and immune reconstitution. Overall survival was similar for patients with RAG, IL2RG, or JAK3 defects and was significantly better compared with patients with ADA or DCLRE1C mutations. Patients with RAG or DCLRE1C mutations had poorer immune reconstitution than other genotypes. Although survival did not correlate with the type of conditioning regimen, recipients of reduced-intensity or myeloablative conditioning had a lower incidence of treatment failure and better T- and B-cell reconstitution, but a higher risk for graft-versus-host disease, compared with those receiving no conditioning or immunosuppression only. Infection-free status and younger age at HCT were associated with improved survival. Typical SCID, leaky SCID, and Omenn syndrome had similar outcomes. Landmark analysis identified CD4+ and CD4+CD45RA+ cell counts at 6 and 12 months post-HCT as biomarkers predictive of overall survival and long-term T-cell reconstitution. Our data emphasize the need for patient-tailored treatment strategies depending upon the underlying SCID genotype.

Furthermore, PSC activation occurs very early during PDAC tumorigenesis8-10, and activated PSCs comprise a substantial fraction of the tumour mass, providing a rich source of readily detectable factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the communication between PSCs and PCCs could be an exploitable target to develop effective strategies for PDAC therapy and diagnosis.

The endoplasmic reticulum resident ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 has recently emerged as a critical regulator of dendritic cell antigen presentation, but its role in T-cell immunity is unknown. Here we show that genetic deletion of Hrd1 in mice inhibits T-cell proliferation, production of IL-2, and differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, and consequently protects mice from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Hrd1 facilitates T-cell proliferation by the destruction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1), and deletion of p27(kip1) in Hrd1-null T-cells rescues proliferative capacity but not the production of cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-gamma and IL-17. T-cell expression of Hrd1 is higher in patients with multiple sclerosis than in healthy individuals, and knockdown of Hrd1 in human CD4(+) T cells inhibits activation and differentiation to Th1 and Th17 cells.

31268928,Melanotic Schwannoma of the Vulva: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"Melanotic schwannoma is a pigmented tumor of peripheral nerve differentiation. Primary cutaneous presentations are extremely rare, as the bulk of melanotic schwannomas tend to develop in paraspinal and axial sites. Tumors arise sporadically and in the setting of the Carney complex. Alterations in the gene encoding protein kinase A regulatory subunit-alpha (PRKAR1A) underlie most patients with the Carney complex and mediate melanotic schwannoma tumorigenesis. Melanotic schwannomas from noncutaneous sites can locally recur and metastasize widely, leading to a recent proposal to change the nomenclature to ""malignant melanotic schwannian tumor."" However, the clinicopathologic features of primary cutaneous melanotic schwannomas are relatively unexplored. We present a case of a nodule arising on the vulva of a 34-year-old woman. Microscopically, a dermal-based, heavily pigmented proliferation of plump spindled and epithelioid cells arrayed in nodules and fascicles was seen. Lesional cells stained positively for S100, Melan-A, and BAP1 but were negative for Prkar1alpha. Next-generation sequencing of a panel of 480 cancer-associated genes revealed that the tumor harbored a PRKAR1A p.S299fs truncating mutation and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 17q, the locus at which PRKAR1A resides. Importantly, no other genetic abnormalities or chromosomal copy number changes were identified. On the basis of combined histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic features, a diagnosis of melanotic schwannoma was rendered.

PRDM1 was revealed to be expressed in 19 out of 58 patients (32.8%) with EN-NK/T-NT, and phosphorylated STAT3 was overexpressed in 42 out of 58 (72.4%). Oncogenic pathways were investigated by NanoString encounter technology in 5 PRDM1(+) and 5 PRDM1(-) EN-NK/T-NT specimens. Multiple oncogenic pathways involved in cell apoptosis, cellcycle (CC) and angiogenesis were discriminately activated in EN-NK/T-NT cases, and in PRDM1(+) cases in particular. The sustained activation of the Janus kinase 3 (JAK)/STAT3 pathway was more pronounced. In addition, missense mutations in the SRC homology 2 domain of STAT3 were detected in 7 out of 37 EN-NK/T-NT cases (18.92%), and the acquired mutation was related to the activation of the JAK3/STAT3 pathway.

However, the role of lncRNA HOTAIR in regulating exosome secretion in HCC cells remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed the relationship between HOTAIR expression and exosome secretion-related genes using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed to validate the effect of HOTAIR on exosome secretion. The transport of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) after overexpression of HOTAIR was detected by transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy analysis of cluster determinant 63 (CD63) with synaptosome associated protein 23 (SNAP23). The mechanism of HOTAIR's regulation of Ras-related protein Rab-35 (RAB35), vesicle associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3), and SNAP23 was assessed using confocal co-localization analysis, phosphorylation assays, and rescue experiments.

30051161,Toxoplasma gondii chromosomal passenger complex is essential for the organization of a functional mitotic spindle: a prerequisite for productive endodyogeny.,"The phylum Apicomplexa encompasses deadly pathogens such as malaria and Cryptosporidium. Apicomplexa cell division is mechanistically divergent from that of their mammalian host, potentially representing an attractive source of drug targets. Depending on the species, apicomplexan parasites can modulate the output of cell division, producing two to thousands of daughter cells at once. The inherent flexibility of their cell division mechanisms allows these parasites to adapt to different niches, facilitating their dissemination. Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites divide using a unique form of cell division called endodyogeny. This process involves a single round of DNA replication, closed nuclear mitosis, and assembly of two daughter cells within a mother. In higher Eukaryotes, the four-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) (Aurora kinase B (ARKB)/INCENP/Borealin/Survivin) promotes chromosome bi-orientation by detaching incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments, playing an essential role in controlling cell division fidelity. Herein, we report the characterization of the Toxoplasma CPC (Aurora kinase 1 (Ark1)/INCENP1/INCENP2). We show that the CPC exhibits dynamic localization in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

Apicomplexa cell division is mechanistically divergent from that of their mammalian host, potentially representing an attractive source of drug targets. Depending on the species, apicomplexan parasites can modulate the output of cell division, producing two to thousands of daughter cells at once. The inherent flexibility of their cell division mechanisms allows these parasites to adapt to different niches, facilitating their dissemination. Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites divide using a unique form of cell division called endodyogeny. This process involves a single round of DNA replication, closed nuclear mitosis, and assembly of two daughter cells within a mother. In higher Eukaryotes, the four-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) (Aurora kinase B (ARKB)INCENPBorealinSurvivin) promotes chromosome bi-orientation by detaching incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments, playing an essential role in controlling cell division fidelity. Herein, we report the characterization of the Toxoplasma CPC (Aurora kinase 1 (Ark1)INCENP1INCENP2). We show that the CPC exhibits dynamic localization in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

30343341,Ataxia telangiectasia alters the ApoB and reelin pathway.,"Autosomal recessive ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, and cerebellar neurodegeneration. A-T is caused by inactivating mutations in the ataxia telangiectasiamutated (ATM) gene, a serine-threonine protein kinase involved in DNA damage response and excitatory neurotransmission. The selective vulnerability of cerebellar Purkinje neurons (PN) to A-T is not well understood. Employing global proteomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid from patients at ages around 15 years, we detected reduced calbindin, reelin, cerebellin-1, cerebellin-3, protocadherin fat 2, sempahorin 7A, and increased apolipoprotein B and J peptides. Bioinformatic enrichment was observed for pathways of lipoproteins, endocytosis, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, peptidase activity, adhesion, calcium binding, and complement immunity. This seemed important since secretion of reelin from glutamatergic afferent axons is crucial for PN lipoprotein receptor endocytosis and lipid signaling. Reelin expression is downregulated by irradiation and reelin/ApoB mutations are known causes of ataxia. Validation efforts in 2-month-old Atm-/- mice before onset of motor deficits confirmed cerebellar transcript reductions for reelin receptors Apoer2/Vldlr with increases for their ligands Apoe/Apoh and cholesterol 24-hydroxylase Cyp46a1. Concomitant dysregulations were found for Vglut2/Sema7a as climbing fiber markers, glutamate receptors like Grin2b, and calcium homeostasis factors (Atp2b2, Calb1, Itpr1), while factors involved in DNA damage, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cell adhesion were normal at this stage. Quantitative immunoblots confirmed ApoB and ApoJ increases and VLDLR reduction in cerebellar tissue at the age of 2 months. These findings show that ApoB excess and reelin signaling deficits reflect the neurodegeneration in A-T in a sensitive and specific way.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of people with gender recorded as female, aged 18-45 years, in the Merative TM MarketScan ® Commercial and Multi-State Medicaid Databases (2006-2016). Opioid use disorder and pregnancy status were identified based on inpatient or outpatient claims for established International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision diagnosis and procedure codes. The main outcomes were buprenorphine and methadone initiation and discontinuation, determined by using pharmacy and outpatient procedure claims. Analyses were conducted at the treatment episode level. Adjusting for insurance status, age, and co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders, we used logistic regression to estimate MOUD initiation and used Cox regression to estimate MOUD discontinuation.
Our sample included 101,772 reproductive-aged people with OUD, encompassing 155,771 treatment episodes (mean age 30.8 years, 64.4% Medicaid insurance, 84.1% White), of whom 2,687 (3.2%, encompassing 3,325 episodes) were pregnant. In the pregnant group, 51.2% of treatment episodes (1,703/3,325) involved psychosocial treatment without MOUD, in comparison with 61.1% (93,156/152,446) in the nonpregnant comparator group. In adjusted analyses assessing likelihood of initiation for individual MOUD, pregnancy status was associated with an increase in buprenorphine (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.57, 95% CI 1.44-1.70) and methadone initiation (aOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.82-2.27).

False positives can be reduced by combining results from orthogonal sequencing methods, but costly. Here, we present variant filtering approaches using logistic regression (LR) and ensemble genotyping to minimize false positives without sacrificing sensitivity. We evaluated the methods using paired WGS datasets of an extended family prepared using two sequencing platforms and a validated set of variants in NA12878. Using LR or ensemble genotyping based filtering, false-negative rates were significantly reduced by 1.1- to 17.8-fold at the same levels of false discovery rates (5.4% for heterozygous and 4.5% for homozygous single nucleotide variants (SNVs); 30.0% for heterozygous and 18.7% for homozygous insertions; 25.2% for heterozygous and 16.6% for homozygous deletions) compared to the filtering based on genotype quality scores.

27311832,CREBBP mutations in individuals without Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome phenotype.,"Mutations in CREBBP cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. By using exome sequencing, and by using Sanger in one patient, CREBBP mutations were detected in 11 patients who did not, or only in a very limited manner, resemble Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. The combined facial signs typical for Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome were absent, none had broad thumbs, and three had only somewhat broad halluces. All had apparent developmental delay (being the reason for molecular analysis); five had short stature and seven had microcephaly. The facial characteristics were variable; main characteristics were short palpebral fissures, telecanthi, depressed nasal ridge, short nose, anteverted nares, short columella, and long philtrum. Six patients had autistic behavior, and two had self-injurious behavior. Other symptoms were recurrent upper airway infections (n = 5), feeding problems (n = 7) and impaired hearing (n = 7). Major malformations occurred infrequently. All patients had a de novo missense mutation in the last part of exon 30 or beginning of exon 31 of CREBBP, between base pairs 5,128 and 5,614 (codons 1,710 and 1,872). No missense or truncating mutations in this region have been described to be associated with the classical Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome phenotype. No functional studies have (yet) been performed, but we hypothesize that the mutations disturb protein-protein interactions by altering zinc finger function. We conclude that patients with missense mutations in this specific CREBBP region show a phenotype that differs substantially from that in patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and may prove to constitute one (or more) separate entities.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\27311832.txt,0,"Mutations in CREBBP cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.

Hemophilia is a congenital bleeding disorder characterized by deficiency of coagulation factor VIII or IX. Hemophilia B is a consequence of factor IX deficiency and has an incidence of 1 in 20,000 male births. A concurrence of these 2 uncommon diseases is rare except in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We report a case of a patient with both Burkitt lymphoma and hemophilia B; this is only such report in China since 1987. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 3-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital because of melena and jaundice for several days. His older brother had died due to hemophilia B and ventricular septal defect. The patient had not experienced any previous episodes of severe bleeding. Gradual abdominal distention was observed after admission; the patient's superficial lymph nodes were not enlarged. Results of blood routine and bone marrow examinations showed no abnormalities. He was diagnosed with sclerosing cholangitis, abdominal infection, and hepatitis. However, after treatment of reducing enzyme activity and eliminating jaundice, the patient's condition deteriorated. Hydrops abdominis was detected on abdominal ultrasonography. Tumor cells were found by pathological examination of peritoneal effusion. Both a c-myc gene translocation and a c-myc-IgH gene fusion were detected. DIAGNOSIS: Burkitt lymphoma and hemophilia B. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was transferred to the Pediatric Hematology Department of our hospital and treated with a modified B-NHL-BFM-95 protocol. During chemotherapy, platelet changes were monitored regularly and blood products were infused timely. OUTCOMES: The patient died of infection and bleeding after chemotherapy.

37931130,Sequence basis for selectivity of ephrin-B2 ligand for Eph receptors and pathogenic henipavirus G glycoproteins.,"Ephrin-B2 (EFNB2) is a ligand for six Eph receptors in humans and functions as a cell entry receptor for several henipaviruses including the Nipah virus (NiV), a pathogenic zoonotic virus with pandemic potential. To understand the sequence basis of promiscuity for EFNB2 binding to the attachment glycoprotein of NiV (NiV-G) and Eph receptors, we performed deep mutagenesis on EFNB2 to identify mutations that enhance binding to NiV-G over EphB2, one of the highest affinity Eph receptors. The mutations highlight how different EFNB2 conformations are selected by NiV-G versus EphB2. Specificity mutations are enriched at the base of the G-H binding loop of EFNB2, especially surrounding a phenylalanine hinge upon which the G-H loop pivots, and at a phenylalanine hook that rotates away from the EFNB2 core to engage Eph receptors. One EFNB2 mutant, D62Q, possesses pan-specificity to the attachment glycoproteins of closely related henipaviruses and has markedly diminished binding to the six Eph receptors. However, EFNB2-D62Q has high residual binding to EphB3 and EphB4. A second deep mutational scan of EFNB2 identified combinatorial mutations to further enhance specificity to NiV-G. A triple mutant of soluble EFNB2, D62Q-Q130L-V167L, has minimal binding to Eph receptors but maintains binding, albeit reduced, to NiV-G. Soluble EFNB2 decoy receptors carrying the specificity mutations were potent neutralizers of chimeric henipaviruses. These findings demonstrate how specific residue changes at the shared binding interface of a promiscuous ligand (EFNB2) can influence selectivity for multiple receptors, and may also offer insight toward the development of henipavirus therapeutics and diagnostics.

30956778,Specific allelic variants of SNPs in the MDM2 and MDMX genes are associated with earlier tumor onset and progression in Caucasian breast cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: Genetic factors play a substantial role in breast cancer etiology. Genes encoding proteins that have key functions in the DNA damage response, such as p53 and its inhibitors MDM2 and MDMX, are most likely candidates to harbor allelic variants that influence breast cancer susceptibility. The aim of our study was to comprehensively analyze the impact of SNPs in the TP53, MDM2, and MDMX genes in conjunction with TP53 mutational status regarding the onset and progression of breast cancer. METHODS: In specimen from 815 breast cancer patients, five SNPs within the selected genes were analyzed: TP53 - Arg72Pro (rs1042522), MDM2 - SNP285 (rs2279744), SNP309 (rs117039649); MDMX - SNP31826 (rs1563828), and SNP34091 (rs4245739). Classification of the tumors was evaluated by histomorphology. Subtyping according hormone receptor status, HER2-status and proliferation rate enabled provision of the clinico-pathological surrogate of intrinsic subtypes. RESULTS: The homozygous C-allele of MDM2 SNP285 was significantly associated with a younger age-at-diagnosis of 44.2 years, in contrast to G/G- and G/C-patients (62.4, 62.7 yrs., respectively; p = 0.0007; log-Rank-test). In contrast, there was no difference regarding the age-at-diagnosis for patients with the respective genotypes of MDM2 SNP309 (p = 0.799; log-Rank-test). In patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and TP53-mutated tumors, however, the T/T-genotype of the MDM2 SNP309 was significantly associated with an earlier average age-at-diagnosis compared with T/G+G/G-patients (53.5 vs. 68.2 yrs; p = 0.002; log-Rank-test). In the triple-negative subgroup, the G/G-patients had an average age-at-diagnosis of 51 years compared with 63 years for SNP309T carriers (p = 0.004; log-Rank-test) indicating a susceptibility of the G/G genotype for the development of triple negative breast cancer. Patients with the A/A-genotype of MDMX SNP31826 with ER-negative tumors were diagnosed 11 years earlier compared with patients and ER-positive tumors (53.2 vs. 64.4 yrs; p = 0.025, log-Rank-test). Furthermore, in luminal B-like patients (HER2-independent) the C/C-genotype of MDMX SNP34091 was significantly correlated with a decreased event-free survival compared with the A/A-genotype (p < 0.001; log-Rank-test).

OBJECTIVE: To report a late dislocation of the vertebra caused by progressive dural ectasia combined with type-1 neurofibromatosis (NF-1) and the clinical results of pseudarthrosis repairs using autologous cultured osteoblasts. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: NF-1 is a well-known genetic disorder that is commonly characterized by spinal deformities including kyphoscoliosis. Late dislocation of the vertebra resulting from progressive dural ectasia after surgical correction of NF-1 scoliosis is a very rare occurrence, and pseudarthrosis frequently develops after surgical intervention for this complex spinal deformity. METHODS: A 32-year-old female patient with NF-1 scoliosis underwent surgical correction with posterior instrumented fusion. Seventeen years later, dislocation of the lumbar spine with implant failure resulting from massive progressive dural ectasia was observed. She underwent anterior interbody fusion three times and posterior instrumented fusion four times for pseudarthrosis followed by surgical deformity correction. For the last operation, autologous cultured osteoblasts were used as a therapeutic approach to repair the pseudarthrosis, and a three-dimensional printing technique was used to understand the surgical anatomy of the dislocated lumbar spine in detail. RESULTS: After the final operation, bone union was achieved and confirmed by clinical and radiological examination. CONCLUSION: Spine surgeons should be knowledgeable about the possibility of late destabilization of the spine, due to pulsatile dural ectasia, and a high rate of pseudarthrosis in neurofibromatosis.

25310214,Langerhans cell histiocytosis.,"BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare histiocytic disorder of unknown etiopathogenesis. Its clinical presentation is variable and ranges from isolated skin or bone disease to a life-threatening multisystem condition. LCH can occur at any age but is more frequent in the pediatric population. A neoplastic origin of this disease has been suggested due to the discovery of the mutually exclusive activating somatic BRAF V600E and MAP2K1 gene mutations that occur in about 75% of patients. METHODS: A survey of recent literature focused on the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Data were collected, analyzed, and discussed with an emphasis on contemporary clinical practice. RESULTS: LCH is common in the pediatric population; compared with adults, children usually have a more aggressive clinical course that requires systemic chemotherapy. Patients with low-risk LCH have an excellent prognosis and a long-term survival rate that may be as high as 99%; by contrast, patients with high-risk LCH have a survival rate close to 80%. Typically, adult patients present with limited skin or bone involvement that can be treated with surgical resection or focal radiation therapy, resulting in an overall survival rate of 100%. Smoking cessation can result in the improvement of respiratory symptoms and the spontaneous resolution of pulmonary LCH. Targeted therapy with BRAF inhibitors has been used in select patients with LCH, and the results have been encouraging. CONCLUSIONS: Our understanding of LCH has improved in the last 20 years. Available treatment regimens can control the disease in the majority of patients.

In the kindred two cases were diagnosed with PCLD, and the left three cases were normal individuals. All the blood samples were preserved at -85  C. Second, we extracted the genomic DNA from the venous blood samples of the kindred using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit and then performed long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with different primers. The exons of PKD1 were all sequenced with the forward and reverse primers to ensure the accuracy of the results. Next, we purified the PCR products and directly sequenced them using Big Dye Terminator Chemistry version 3.1. The sequencing reaction was conducted with BiomekFX (Beckman). Finally, we analyzed the results. RESULTS: A total of 42 normal exons were identified in detecting mutations of the PKD1 gene. A synonymous mutation occurred in exon 5. The mutation was a homozygous T in the proband and was C in the reference sequence. This mutation was located in the third codon and did not change the amino acid encoded by the codon. Missense mutations occurred in exons 11 and 35. These mutations were located in the second codon; they changed the amino acid sequence and existed in the dbSNP library.

26468051,The common gamma-chain cytokine receptor: tricks-and-treats for T cells.,"Originally identified as the third subunit of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex, the common gamma-chain (gammac) also acts as a non-redundant receptor subunit for a series of other cytokines, collectively known as gammac family cytokines. gammac plays essential roles in T cell development and differentiation, so that understanding the molecular basis of its signaling and regulation is a critical issue in T cell immunology. Unlike most other cytokine receptors, gammac is thought to be constitutively expressed and limited in its function to the assembly of high-affinity cytokine receptors. Surprisingly, recent studies reported a series of findings that unseat gammac as a simple housekeeping gene, and unveiled gammac as a new regulatory molecule in T cell activation and differentiation. Cytokine-independent binding of gammac to other cytokine receptor subunits suggested a pre-association model of gammac with proprietary cytokine receptors. Also, identification of a gammac splice isoform revealed expression of soluble gammac proteins (sgammac). sgammac directly interacted with surface IL-2Rbeta to suppress IL-2 signaling and to promote pro-inflammatory Th17 cell differentiation. As a result, endogenously produced sgammac exacerbated autoimmune inflammatory disease, while the removal of endogenous sgammac significantly ameliorated disease outcome. These data provide new insights into the role of both membrane and soluble gammac in cytokine signaling, and open new venues to interfere and modulate gammac signaling during immune activation.

31239718,Ilex hainanensis Merr targets ITGAV to suppress the proliferation and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells.,"Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify effective and safe therapeutic agents against OS. It has been reported that Ilex hainanensis Merr (IME) possesses antitumor properties. Integrin subunit alpha V (ITGAV) is important for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of tumors. Purpose: The objective of this study was to whether IME can play a role in the treatment of osteosarcoma by regulating ITGAV. Methods: Western blot and real-time PCR were used to detect the expression of ITGAV in non-tumorous tissues, osteosarcoma tissues, and metastatic tumors. The expression of ITGAV in MG63, U2OS, and hFOB1. A total of 19 cells was determined through Western blotting and real-time PCR. The expression of ITGAV in OS cells treated with different concentrations of DDP was determined through Western blotting. Agter transfecting with control or si-ITGAV, and subsequently treated with control or 5 mumol/L DDP, MTT assay and transwell assay were used to detect the proliferaion and migration of cells. Western blot was used to detect the expression of ITGAV in cells treated with different concentrations of IME and MTT assay and transwell assay were used to detect the proliferaion and migration of cells. MG63 and U2OS cells were treated with control, 5 mumol/L DDP, 25 mumol/L IME, or 5 mumol/L DDP combined with 25 mumol/L IME, the expression of ITGAV was determined through Western blotting and real-time PCR.

Results: ITGAV was highly expressed in tumors, with the highest expression found in metastatic tumors and higher in OS cells. A low concentration of DDP (5 mumol/L) inhibited the expression of ITGAV. However, ITGAV may be related to the development of resistance to DDP. Silencing of ITGAV downregulates the proliferation and migration of OS cells as the effect of low-concentration DDP (5 mumol/L). IME inhibited the proliferation and migration of MG63 and U2OS cells in a concentration-dependent manner and decreased the expression of ITGAV. MTT and Transwell assays showed that 25 mumol/L IME and 5 mumol/L DDP exhibited similar inhibitory effects on the proliferation and migration of OS cells. The combination of IME with DDP resulted in the amplification of these inhibitory effects. Both DDP and IME downregulated the expression of ITGAV, and the inhibition of ITGAV was amplified by the combination of IME with DDP. In-vivo studies have shown that IME and DDP, independently or in combination, may significantly inhibit the metastasis of OS to the lungs. Conclusion: IME may reduce the resistance of OS cells to DDP to some extent.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31239718.txt,1,"Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify effective and safe therapeutic agents against OS. It has been reported that Ilex hainanensis Merr (IME) possesses antitumor properties. Integrin subunit alpha V (ITGAV) is important for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of tumors. Purpose: The objective of this study was to whether IME can play a role in the treatment of osteosarcoma by regulating ITGAV. Methods: Western blot and real-time PCR were used to detect the expression of ITGAV in non-tumorous tissues, osteosarcoma tissues, and metastatic tumors. The expression of ITGAV in MG63, U2OS, and hFOB1. A total of 19 cells was determined through Western blotting and real-time PCR. The expression of ITGAV in OS cells treated with different concentrations of DDP was determined through Western blotting. Agter transfecting with control or si-ITGAV, and subsequently treated with control or 5 mumolL DDP, MTT assay and transwell assay were used to detect the proliferaion and migration of cells.

29428355,Dissecting Wnt Signaling for Melanocyte Regulation during Wound Healing.,"Abnormal pigmentation is commonly seen in the wound scar. Despite advancements in the research of wound healing, little is known about the repopulation of melanocytes in the healed skin. Previous studies have shown the capacity of melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicle to contribute skin epidermal melanocytes after injury in mice and humans. Here, we focused on the Wnt pathway, known to be a vital regulator of melanocyte stem cells in efforts to better understand the regulation of follicle-derived epidermal melanocytes during wound healing. We showed that transgenic expression of Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 in melanocytes reduced epidermal melanocytes in the wound scar. Conversely, forced activation of Wnt signaling by genetically stabilizing beta-catenin in melanocytes increases epidermal melanocytes. Furthermore, we show that deletion of Wntless (Wls), a gene required for Wnt ligand secretion, within epithelial cells results in failure in activating Wnt signaling in adjacent epidermal melanocytes. These results show the essential function of extrinsic Wnt ligands in initiating Wnt signaling in follicle-derived epidermal melanocytes during wound healing. Collectively, our results suggest the potential for Wnt signal regulation to promote melanocyte regeneration and provide a potential molecular window to promote proper melanocyte regeneration after wounding and in conditions such as vitiligo.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\29428355.txt,0,"Abnormal pigmentation is commonly seen in the wound scar.

31164412,T-Cell Deletion of MyD88 Connects IL17 and IkappaBzeta to RAS Oncogenesis.,"Cancer development requires a favorable tissue microenvironment. By deleting Myd88 in keratinocytes or specific bone marrow subpopulations in oncogenic RAS-mediated skin carcinogenesis, we show that IL17 from infiltrating T cells and IkappaBzeta signaling in keratinocytes are essential to produce a permissive microenvironment and tumor formation. Both normal and RAS-transformed keratinocytes respond to tumor promoters by activating canonical NF-kappaB and IkappaBzeta signaling, releasing specific cytokines and chemokines that attract Th17 cells through MyD88-dependent signaling in T cells. The release of IL17 into the microenvironment elevates IkappaBzeta in normal and RAS-transformed keratinocytes. Activation of IkappaBzeta signaling is required for the expression of specific promoting factors induced by IL17 in normal keratinocytes and constitutively expressed in RAS-initiated keratinocytes. Deletion of Nfkbiz in keratinocytes impairs RAS-mediated benign tumor formation. Transcriptional profiling and gene set enrichment analysis of IkappaBzeta-deficient RAS-initiated keratinocytes indicate that IkappaBzeta signaling is common for RAS transformation of multiple epithelial cancers. Probing The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets using this transcriptional profile indicates that reduction of IkappaBzeta signaling during cancer progression associates with poor prognosis in RAS-driven human cancers. IMPLICATIONS: The paradox that elevation of IkappaBzeta and stimulation of IkappaBzeta signaling through tumor extrinsic factors is required for RAS-mediated benign tumor formation while relative IkappaBzeta expression is reduced in advanced cancers with poor prognosis implies that tumor cells switch from microenvironmental dependency early in carcinogenesis to cell-autonomous pathways during cancer progression.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31164412.txt,1,"Cancer development requires a favorable tissue microenvironment.

Phospho-histone H3 (pH3), a major product of AURKB, is increased in most resistant cells and treatment with AURKB inhibitors reduces the levels of pH3, triggering G1/S arrest and polyploidy. Senescence is subsequently induced in cells with acquired mutations while, in their absence, polyploidy is followed by cell death. Finally, in NSCLC patients, pH3 levels are increased after progression on EGFR TKIs and high pH3 baseline correlates with shorter survival.

26134128,"Herpesvirus Genome Recognition Induced Acetylation of Nuclear IFI16 Is Essential for Its Cytoplasmic Translocation, Inflammasome and IFN-beta Responses.","The IL-1beta and type I interferon-beta (IFN-beta) molecules are important inflammatory cytokines elicited by the eukaryotic host as innate immune responses against invading pathogens and danger signals. Recently, a predominantly nuclear gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) involved in transcriptional regulation has emerged as an innate DNA sensor which induced IL-1beta and IFN-beta production through inflammasome and STING activation, respectively. Herpesvirus (KSHV, EBV, and HSV-1) episomal dsDNA genome recognition by IFI16 leads to IFI16-ASC-procaspase-1 inflammasome association, cytoplasmic translocation and IL-1beta production. Independent of ASC, HSV-1 genome recognition results in IFI16 interaction with STING in the cytoplasm to induce interferon-beta production. However, the mechanisms of IFI16-inflammasome formation, cytoplasmic redistribution and STING activation are not known. Our studies here demonstrate that recognition of herpesvirus genomes in the nucleus by IFI16 leads into its interaction with histone acetyltransferase p300 and IFI16 acetylation resulting in IFI16-ASC interaction, inflammasome assembly, increased interaction with Ran-GTPase, cytoplasmic redistribution, caspase-1 activation, IL-1beta production, and interaction with STING which results in IRF-3 phosphorylation, nuclear pIRF-3 localization and interferon-beta production. ASC and STING knockdowns did not affect IFI16 acetylation indicating that this modification is upstream of inflammasome-assembly and STING-activation. Vaccinia virus replicating in the cytoplasm did not induce nuclear IFI16 acetylation and cytoplasmic translocation.

31097693,MEK inhibitors activate Wnt signalling and induce stem cell plasticity in colorectal cancer.,"In colorectal cancer (CRC), aberrant Wnt signalling is essential for tumorigenesis and maintenance of cancer stem cells. However, how other oncogenic pathways converge on Wnt signalling to modulate stem cell homeostasis in CRC currently remains poorly understood. Using large-scale compound screens in CRC, we identify MEK1/2 inhibitors as potent activators of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Targeting MEK increases Wnt activity in different CRC cell lines and murine intestine in vivo. Truncating mutations of APC generated by CRISPR/Cas9 strongly synergize with MEK inhibitors in enhancing Wnt responses in isogenic CRC models. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that MEK inhibition induces a rapid downregulation of AXIN1. Using patient-derived CRC organoids, we show that MEK inhibition leads to increased Wnt activity, elevated LGR5 levels and enrichment of gene signatures associated with stemness and cancer relapse.

24819622,Surgical treatment of lumbosacral pseudarthrosis and spondyloptosis in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 and a large lumbar anterior meningocele. Case report and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Lumbar anterior meningocele (MC) is rare in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Although spinal fusion with maximum possible resection of the cele might be indicated in these special cases, reports describing operative procedures are lacking. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a young woman with NF1 and lower back pain due to lumbar anterior MC, extensive osteolysis, and deformation of the lumbar spine. After Harrington spondylodesis from T12 to S1 in 1989, she developed lumbosacral pseudarthrosis and transcutaneous migration of the spondylodesis. Thus the left pole of the spondylodesis was shortened below the level of L5 in 2005. Years later, the patient presented with lower back pain and wound infection. Imaging revealed the MC and avulsion of the right S1 screw with lumbosacral pseudarthrosis and spondyloptosis, and transcutaneous migration of the right spondylodesis pole. Three-stage surgery was indicated with explantation of the Harrington system in the first step and posterior fusion from T10 to S2 in the second step. Finally, vertebral resection, gathering of the cele, and implantation of a customized titanium cage was achieved through an anterior transabdominal approach. Postoperatively, the patient reported sufficient reduction of lower back pain. CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar anterior MC is rare in patients with NF1 and may cause spinal instability.

Current WHO anaemia definitions are based on statistical thresholds (fifth centiles) set more than 50 years ago. We sought to establish evidence for the statistical haemoglobin thresholds for anaemia that can be applied globally and inform WHO and clinical guidelines.
In this analysis we identified international data sources from populations in the USA, England, Australia, China, the Netherlands, Canada, Ecuador, and Bangladesh with sufficient clinical and laboratory information collected between 1998 and 2020 to obtain a healthy reference sample. Individuals with clinical or biochemical evidence of a condition that could reduce haemoglobin concentrations were excluded. We estimated haemoglobin thresholds (ie, 5th centiles) for children aged 6-23 months, 24-59 months, 5-11 years, and 12-17 years, and adults aged 18-65 years (including during pregnancy) for individual datasets and pooled across data sources. We also collated findings from three large-scale genetic studies to summarise genetic variants affecting haemoglobin concentrations in different ancestral populations.

In pooled analyses of adults aged 18-65 years, the fifth centile was 119·7 g/L (90% CI 119·1-120·3) in 3640 non-pregnant females and 134·9 g/L (134·2-135·6) in 2377 males.

There were insufficient data for adults older than 65 years. We did not identify ancestry-specific high prevalence of non-clinically relevant genetic variants that influence haemoglobin concentrations.

31534167,Non-hematopoietic STAT6 induces epithelial tight junction dysfunction and promotes intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis.,"Enhanced gut permeability due to dysregulated epithelial tight junction is often associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which have a greater risk for developing colorectal cancer. STAT6 activation was detected in inflamed colonic epithelium of active IBD patients, suggesting a role of epithelial STAT6 in colitis development. Here, we demonstrated that non-hematopoietic STAT6, but not hematopoietic STAT6, triggered DSS-induced colitis and subsequent tumorigenesis. This could be due to the enhancing-effect of STAT6 on gut permeability and microbiota translocation via interruption of epithelial tight junction integrity. Mechanistically, long-myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK1) was identified as a target of STAT6, leading to epithelial tight junction dysfunction and microbiota-driven colitis. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-13, which was primarily derived from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in a microbiota-dependent way, inhibited epithelial STAT6 activation and improved gut permeability and DSS-induced colitis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces murine intestinal tumor formation, and tumoral p-STAT6 levels positively correlated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of human colorectal cancer. Thus, our study reveals a direct role of STAT6 in the disruption of epithelial tight junction integrity and colitis development, and suggests STAT6 as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic target for IBD and colitis-associated cancer.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31534167.txt,1,"Enhanced gut permeability due to dysregulated epithelial tight junction is often associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which have a greater risk for developing colorectal cancer.

30914778,A combined gene expression tool for parallel histological prediction and gene fusion detection in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Accurate histological classification and identification of fusion genes represent two cornerstones of clinical diagnostics in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we present a NanoString gene expression platform and a novel platform-independent, single sample predictor (SSP) of NSCLC histology for combined, simultaneous, histological classification and fusion gene detection in minimal formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. The SSP was developed in 68 NSCLC tumors of adenocarcinoma (AC), squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) histology, based on NanoString expression of 11 (CHGA, SYP, CD56, SFTPG, NAPSA, TTF-1, TP73L, KRT6A, KRT5, KRT40, KRT16) relevant genes for IHC-based NSCLC histology classification. The SSP was combined with a gene fusion detection module (analyzing ALK, RET, ROS1, MET, NRG1, and NTRK1) into a multicomponent NanoString assay. The histological SSP was validated in six cohorts varying in size (n = 11-199), tissue origin (early or advanced disease), histological composition (including undifferentiated cancer), and gene expression platform. Fusion gene detection revealed five EML4-ALK fusions, four KIF5B-RET fusions, two CD74-NRG1 fusion and three MET exon 14 skipping events among 131 tested cases. The histological SSP was successfully trained and tested in the development cohort (mean AUC = 0.96 in iterated test sets). The SSP proved successful in predicting histology of NSCLC tumors of well-defined subgroups and difficult undifferentiated morphology irrespective of gene expression data platform. Discrepancies between gene expression prediction and histologic diagnosis included cases with mixed histologies, true large cell carcinomas, or poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with mucin expression. In summary, we present a proof-of-concept multicomponent assay for parallel histological classification and multiplexed fusion gene detection in archival tissue, including a novel platform-independent histological SSP classifier. The assay and SSP could serve as a promising complement in the routine evaluation of diagnostic lung cancer biopsies.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\30914778.txt,1,"Accurate histological classification and identification of fusion genes represent two cornerstones of clinical diagnostics in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Here, to gain a better understanding of mCA rates in genetically diverse populations, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 67,390 individuals from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. We observed higher sensitivity with whole-genome sequencing data, compared with array-based data, in uncovering mCAs at low mutant cell fractions and found that individuals of European ancestry have the highest rates of autosomal mCAs and the lowest rates of chromosome X mCAs, compared with individuals of African or Hispanic ancestry. Although further studies in diverse populations will be needed to replicate our findings, we report three loci associated with loss of chromosome X, associations between autosomal mCAs and rare variants in DCPS, ADM17, PPP1R16B and TET2 and ancestry-specific variants in ATM and MPL with mCAs in cis.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\37904051.txt,0,"Megabase-scale mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) in blood are prognostic markers for a host of human diseases.

27651169,Gene panel sequencing improves the diagnostic work-up of patients with idiopathic erythrocytosis and identifies new mutations.,"Erythrocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by increased red cell mass and elevated hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. Several genetic variants have been identified as causes for erythrocytosis in genes belonging to different pathways including oxygen sensing, erythropoiesis and oxygen transport. However, despite clinical investigation and screening for these mutations, the cause of disease cannot be found in a considerable number of patients, who are classified as having idiopathic erythrocytosis. In this study, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing panel encompassing the exonic regions of 21 genes from relevant pathways (~79 Kb) and sequenced 125 patients with idiopathic erythrocytosis. The panel effectively screened 97% of coding regions of these genes, with an average coverage of 450x. It identified 51 different rare variants, all leading to alterations of protein sequence, with 57 out of 125 cases (45.6%) having at least one of these variants. Ten of these were known erythrocytosis-causing variants, which had been missed following existing diagnostic algorithms. Twenty-two were novel variants in erythrocytosis-associated genes (EGLN1, EPAS1, VHL, BPGM, JAK2, SH2B3) and in novel genes included in the panel (e.g. EPO, EGLN2, HIF3A, OS9), some with a high likelihood of functionality, for which future segregation, functional and replication studies will be useful to provide further evidence for causality.

24498434,Structural and functional characterization of cargo-binding sites on the mu4-subunit of adaptor protein complex 4.,"Adaptor protein (AP) complexes facilitate protein trafficking by playing key roles in the selection of cargo molecules to be sorted in post-Golgi compartments. Four AP complexes (AP-1 to AP-4) contain a medium-sized subunit (mu1-mu4) that recognizes YXXO-sequences (O is a bulky hydrophobic residue), which are sorting signals in transmembrane proteins. A conserved, canonical region in mu subunits mediates recognition of YXXO-signals by means of a critical aspartic acid. Recently we found that a non-canonical YXXO-signal on the cytosolic tail of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) binds to a distinct region of the mu4 subunit of the AP-4 complex. In this study we aimed to determine the functionality of both binding sites of mu4 on the recognition of the non-canonical YXXO-signal of APP. We found that substitutions in either binding site abrogated the interaction with the APP-tail in yeast-two hybrid experiments. Further characterization by isothermal titration calorimetry showed instead loss of binding to the APP signal with only the substitution R283D at the non-canonical site, in contrast to a decrease in binding affinity with the substitution D190A at the canonical site. We solved the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of the D190A mutant bound to this non-canonical YXXO-signal. This structure showed no significant difference compared to that of wild-type mu4. Both differential scanning fluorimetry and limited proteolysis analyses demonstrated that the D190A substitution rendered mu4 less stable, suggesting an explanation for its lower binding affinity to the APP signal. Finally, in contrast to overexpression of the D190A mutant, and acting in a dominant-negative manner, overexpression of mu4 with either a F255A or a R283D substitution at the non-canonical site halted APP transport at the Golgi apparatus. Together, our analyses support that the functional recognition of the non-canonical YXXO-signal of APP is limited to the non-canonical site of mu4.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\24498434.txt,0,"Adaptor protein (AP) complexes facilitate protein trafficking by playing key roles in the selection of cargo molecules to be sorted in post-Golgi compartments.

This is a single-center retrospective study. A total of 135 patients with EEC and EAH receiving fertility-preserving treatment and molecular classification were reviewed. The distribution of the four types of molecular classification was described. The impact of non-specific molecular profile (NSMP), mismatch repair-deficiency (MMRd), and PTEN, KRAS and PIK3CA gene mutation on the outcome of fertility-preserving treatment was analyzed.

37595758,Gene editing of hematopoietic stem cells restores T cell response in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a hyperinflammatory disorder characterized by a life-threatening cytokine storm and immunopathology. Familial HLH type 3 (FHL3) accounts for ∼30% of all inborn HLH cases worldwide. It is caused by mutations in the UNC13D gene, which result in impaired degranulation of cytotoxic vesicles and hence compromised T and NK cell-mediated killing. Current treatment protocols, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, still show high mortality.
We sought to develop and evaluate a curative genome editing strategy in the preclinical FHL3 Jinx mouse model. Jinx mice harbor a cryptic splice donor site (cSD) in Unc13d intron 26 and develop clinical symptoms of human FHL3 upon infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).
We employed CRISPR-Cas technology to delete the disease-underlying mutation in HSCs, and transplanted Unc13d-edited stem cells into busulfan-conditioned Jinx recipient mice. Safety studies included extensive genotyping and CAST-Seq based off-target analyses. Cure from HLH predisposition was assessed by LCMV infection.
Hematopoietic cells isolated from transplanted mice revealed efficient gene editing (>95%), polyclonality of the T cell receptor repertoire, and neither signs of off-target effects nor leukemogenesis. Unc13d transcription levels of edited and wildtype cells were comparable. While LCMV challenge resulted in acute HLH in Jinx mice transplanted with mock-edited HSCs, Jinx mice grafted with Unc13d-edited cells showed rapid virus clearance and protection from HLH.

Jinx mice harbor a cryptic splice donor site (cSD) in Unc13d intron 26 and develop clinical symptoms of human FHL3 upon infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We employed CRISPR-Cas technology to delete the disease-underlying mutation in HSCs, and transplanted Unc13d-edited stem cells into busulfan-conditioned Jinx recipient mice. Safety studies included extensive genotyping and CAST-Seq based off-target analyses. Cure from HLH predisposition was assessed by LCMV infection. Hematopoietic cells isolated from transplanted mice revealed efficient gene editing (95), polyclonality of the T cell receptor repertoire, and neither signs of off-target effects nor leukemogenesis. Unc13d transcription levels of edited and wildtype cells were comparable. While LCMV challenge resulted in acute HLH in Jinx mice transplanted with mock-edited HSCs, Jinx mice grafted with Unc13d-edited cells showed rapid virus clearance and protection from HLH. Our study demonstrates that transplantation of CRISPR-Cas edited HSCs supports the development of a functional polyclonal T cell response in the absence of genotoxicity-associated clonal outgrowth.",[],0

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of resorbable blasting media (RBM) treatment on early stability of orthodontic mini-implants by mechanical, histomorphometric, and histological analyses. Methods. Ninety-six (64 for mechanical study and 32 for histological study and histomorphometric analysis) titanium orthodontic mini-implants (OMIs) with machined (machined group) or RBM-treated (CaP) surface (RBM group) were implanted in the tibiae of 24 rabbits. Maximum initial torque (MIT) was measured during insertion, and maximum removal torque (MRT) and removal angular momentum (RAM) were measured at 2 and 4 weeks after implantation. Bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone area (BA) were analyzed at 4 weeks after implantation. Results. RBM group exhibited significantly lower MIT and significantly higher MRT and RAM at 2 weeks than machined group. No significant difference in MRT, RAM, and BIC between the two groups was noted at 4 weeks, although BA was significantly higher in RBM group than in machined group. RBM group showed little bone resorption, whereas machined group showed new bone formation after bone resorption. Conclusions. RBM surface treatment can provide early stability of OMIs around 2 weeks after insertion, whereas stability of machined surface OMIs may decrease in early stages because of bone resorption, although it can subsequently recover by new bone apposition.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\26942200.txt,0,"Introduction.

Here, we report a rare case of non-Langerhans-cell histiocytosis in a 51-year-old woman who presented with severe symptoms of pericardial effusion. Radiologic investigation also detected multiple bone (lower limbs, vertebrae, ribs, and ilium) lesions. Resected pericardium showed abundant mono- or multi-nucleated non-foamy histiocytes (CD68+/CD163+/S-100+/CD1alpha-/langerin-) in a fibroinflammatory background. The histiocytes demonstrated emperipolesis of lymphocytes, a hallmark feature of Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD). However, molecular analysis revealed a BRAF V600E mutation of the proliferating histiocytes, highlighting the neoplastic features frequently observed in another non-Langerhans-cell histiocytosis known as Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-one randomly selected patients, with primary, previously untreated RCC, with complete clinicopathohistological data were analyzed. NAT samples were available for 37 cases. Expression of p53,  40p53 and  133p53 was determined using RT-qPCR. A functional yeast-based assay was performed to analyze p53 mutations. RESULTS: More than half (56.1%) of patients harbored functional p53 mutations, and they were significantly younger than those with wild type (WT) p53 (P = 0.032). Expression of p53,  40p53, and  133p53 was upregulated in mutant (MT) p53 RCC compared to WT p53 RCC tissues. However, there was no difference in expression of these isoforms between MT p53 RCC tissues and NAT.

All application forms used to send patients in for APC and MUTYH variant analysis between 1992 and 2017 were collected (n = 2082). Using the data provided on the application form, the APC and biallelic MUTYH prevalence was determined and possible predictive factors were examined using multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis in SPSS. The prevalence of disease causing variants in the APC gene significantly increases with adenoma count while MAP shows a peak prevalence in individuals with 50-99 adenomas. Logistic regression analysis shows significant odds ratios for adenoma count, age at diagnosis, and, interestingly, a decline in the chance of finding a variant in either gene over time. Moreover, in 22% (43/200) of patients with FAP-related extracolonic manifestations a variant was identified. The overall detection rates are above 10% for patients with >10 adenomas aged <60 and >20 adenomas aged <70. Patients with variants outside these criteria had FAP-related extracolonic manifestations, colorectal cancer aged <40, somatic KRAS c.34G > T variant in the tumor or a first-degree relative with >10 adenomas.

The present review aims to determine how the metastatic-linked protein anterior gradient homologue 2 (AGR2) operates to affect cancer progression, and to identify associated potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers, particularly in central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Studies that show a high expression level of AGR2, and associate the protein expression with the resilience to chemotherapeutic treatments or with poor cancer survival, are reported. The primary protein structures of the seven variants of AGR2, including their functional domains, are summarized. Based on experiments in various biological models, this review shows an orchestra of multiple molecules that regulate AGR2 expression, including a feedback loop with p53. The AGR2-associated molecular functions and pathways including genomic integrity, proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, adhesion, migration, stemness, and inflammation, are detailed. In addition, the mechanisms that can enable the rampant oncogenic effects of AGR2 are clarified. The different strategies used to therapeutically target AGR2-positive cancer cells are evaluated in light of the current evidence.

Unfortunately, a patient's subgroup did not benefit from immunotherapy. Caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX-2) would seem to influence immunotherapy's sensitivity, promoting the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (CXCL14) expression. Therefore, we investigated CDX-2 role as a prognostic-predictive marker in patients with mCRC MSI-H. We retrospectively collected data from 14 MSI-H mCRC patients treated with ICIs between 2019 and 2021. The primary endpoint was the 12-month progression-free-survival (PFS) rate. The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), PFS, objective response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR). The PFS rate at 12 months was 81% in CDX-2 positive patients vs 0% in CDX-2 negative patients (p = 0.0011). The median PFS was not reached (NR) in the CDX-2 positive group versus 2.07 months (95%CI 2.07-10.8) in CDX-2 negative patients (p = 0.0011).

All CDX-2-positive patients achieved a disease response, one of them a complete response. Among CDX-2-negative patients, one achieved stable disease, while the other progressed rapidly (ORR: 100% vs 0%, p = 0.0005; DCR: 100% vs 50%, p = 0.02).

30910249,"Molecular markers in recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancers.","OBJECTIVES: Stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancers have low recurrence rates and often do not receive adjuvant therapy. We compared recurrent cases to matched non-recurrent controls to evaluate for molecular markers associated with higher risk of recurrence. METHODS: A case-control study including all cases of recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer at one institution in a ten-year period. Cases were matched to controls by age, BMI, weight and stage. Molecular testing and immunohistochemistry were performed on archival tumor specimens: microsatellite instability (MSI-H), mismatch repair status, POLE mutational status, and next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: 15 stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancer cases with recurrent disease and available tumor specimens were identified. CTNNB1 and MSI-H were present at significantly higher rates in cases than controls (CTNNB1 60% vs. 28%, OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.1-14.7, p = 0.04 and MSI-H 53% vs. 21%, OR 4.4, 95%CI 1.1-17.0, p = 0.03).

We compared recurrent cases to matched non-recurrent controls to evaluate for molecular markers associated with higher risk of recurrence. METHODS: A case-control study including all cases of recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer at one institution in a ten-year period. Cases were matched to controls by age, BMI, weight and stage. Molecular testing and immunohistochemistry were performed on archival tumor specimens: microsatellite instability (MSI-H), mismatch repair status, POLE mutational status, and next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: 15 stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancer cases with recurrent disease and available tumor specimens were identified. CTNNB1 and MSI-H were present at significantly higher rates in cases than controls (CTNNB1 60 vs. 28, OR 3.9, 95CI 1.1-14.7, p  0.04 and MSI-H 53 vs. 21, OR 4.4, 95CI 1.1-17.0, p  0.03). POLE mutations were found in 0 of cases vs. 7 of controls (p  0.54). Among specimens demonstrating microsatellite stability (MSS), 100 of cases vs. 26 of controls had CTNNB1 mutations (p  0.001). CTNNB1 wild type tumors were MSI-H in 100 of cases vs. 19 of controls (p  0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to controls, CTNNB1 mutation is present at significantly higher rates in recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancers and is found most commonly in MSS tumors. MSI-H is also present at significantly higher rates in recurrent cases. These markers may be useful for prognostic risk stratification and adjuvant therapy decision-making in this otherwise low-risk population.","['tumor', 'cancer']",1

31169702,Intrahepatic adrenocortical adenoma arising from adrenohepatic fusion mimicking hepatic malignancy: Two case reports.,"RATIONALE: Intrahepatic adrenocortical adenoma (IAA) arising from adrenohepatic fusion (AHF) is rare and its imaging findings are not well established. Moreover, it is easily misdiagnosed as malignant hepatic tumor in patients at risk of malignancy. Its key finding is the connection between the tumor and adrenal gland. When IAA from AHF is suspected, biopsy should be considered to avoid unnecessary surgery. Herein, we report 2 cases of IAA from AHF. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 59-year-old woman was admitted due to a 1.5-cm hypoechoic nodule in the right hepatic lobe detected on ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance due to chronic hepatitis B. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to evaluate the hepatic mass. Another 75-year-old woman was admitted due to rectal adenocarcinoma detected on colonoscopy. Contrast-enhanced CT depicted a 2.5-cm mass in the right hepatic lobe. DIAGNOSIS: In case 1, CT and MRI showed a 1.5-cm subcapsular mass in the right hepatic lobe with typical findings of HCC in a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The mass was confirmed as IAA from AHF after the laparoscopic surgery. In case 2, CT showed advanced rectal malignancy and a 2.5-cm poorly enhancing mass in the right hepatic lobe. The tentative diagnosis was hepatic metastasis. However, based on the connection between the tumor and adrenal gland during preoperative review, the presumed diagnosis was changed to IAA from AHF, which was confirmed on biopsy. INTERVENTIONS: The hepatic mass connected with the right adrenal gland was laparoscopically resected in case 1.

However, the association of cerebral aneurysms with this syndrome has not been reported yet. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 39-year-old Japanese man presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured giant fusiform middle cerebral artery aneurysm. We diagnosed him with Cowden syndrome by clinical presentations as outlined in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's criteria. As the ruptured fusiform aneurysm involved a middle cerebral artery bifurcation, we prepared for extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery. We successfully performed a surgical clipping using multiple tandem clipping techniques and suction decompression techniques. Bypass surgery was not performed as reconstruction of the M2 trunks was successfully completed. CONCLUSIONS: We present this rare case that potentially indicates an association between cerebral aneurysms and Cowden syndrome. Because vascular anomalies are not included in the diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome, intracranial vascular anomalies may be underestimated.

Bypass surgery was not performed as reconstruction of the M2 trunks was successfully completed. CONCLUSIONS: We present this rare case that potentially indicates an association between cerebral aneurysms and Cowden syndrome. Because vascular anomalies are not included in the diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome, intracranial vascular anomalies may be underestimated. We therefore recommended a careful search of vascular diseases, including cerebral aneurysms, in cases of Cowden syndrome.",['cancer'],0
30953289,Noninvasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features (NIFTP): Update and Diagnostic Considerations-a Review.,"Advances in our understanding of thyroid lesions, especially those entities with an indolent behavior, has led clinicians to question the most appropriate surgical management of such thyroid nodules. Several studies have shown that the non-invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas (NI-EFVPC) exhibits poor histopathologic diagnostic reproducibility and have been over-treated as conventional thyroid cancer. In 2015, an international thyroid working group re-evaluated NI-EFVPC and its diagnostic criteria. The new terminology of ""noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features"" (NIFTP) was accordingly introduced to replace NI-EFVPC. The literature has emphasized that NIFTPs are biologically similar to follicular adenomas lacking lymph node metastases and/or recurrence. While the definition of NIFTP is based on specific morphological parameters, recent studies have questioned whether the criterion allowing less than 1% of true papillae should be revised to a total absence of papillae. The motivation for this revision is the rare finding, in some studies, of lymph nodes with metastatic NIFTP. This review evaluates the existing published series of NIFTP cases, clinical consequences of NIFTP, and emerging changes in the diagnostic criteria for NIFTP. The introduction of NIFTP has resulted in significant impact on the clinical management of thyroid nodules. Recent revisions in the morphological criteria for NIFTP emphasize the need to adhere to very stringent histomorphologic criteria when making a diagnosis of NIFTP. The adoption of NIFTP terminology instead of NI-EFVPC is associated with conservative lobectomy without radioactive iodine treatment in the majority of cases.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\30953289.txt,1,"Advances in our understanding of thyroid lesions, especially those entities with an indolent behavior, has led clinicians to question the most appropriate surgical management of such thyroid nodules.

Current treatment strategies with GEM result in suboptimal therapeutic outcome owing to microenvironmental resistance and rapid metabolic degradation of GEM. To address these challenges, physicochemical and cell-biological properties of both covalently conjugated and non-covalently stabilized variants of GEM-containing PG-co-PCL architectures have been evaluated. Self-assembly behavior, drug loading and release capacity, cytotoxicity, and cellular uptake properties of these constructs in monolayer and in spheroid cultures of PDAC cells are investigated. To realize the covalently conjugated carrier systems, GEM, in conjunction with a tertiary amine, is attached to the polycarbonate block grafted from the PG-co-PCL core. It is observed that pH-dependent ionization properties of these amine side-chains direct the formation of self-assembly of block copolymers in the form of nanoparticles. For non-covalent encapsulation, a facile ""solvent-shifting"" technique is adopted. Fabrication techniques are found to control colloidal and cellular properties of GEM-loaded nanoconstructs.

29059455,Angiocrine Wnt signaling controls liver growth and metabolic maturation in mice.,"Postnatal liver development is characterized by hepatocyte growth, proliferation, and functional maturation. Notably, canonical Wnt signaling in hepatocytes has been identified as an important regulator of final adult liver size and metabolic liver zonation. The cellular origin of Wnt ligands responsible for homeostatic liver/body weight ratio (LW/BW) remained unclear, which was also attributable to a lack of suitable endothelial Cre driver mice. To comprehensively analyze the effects of hepatic angiocrine Wnt signaling on liver development and metabolic functions, we used endothelial subtype-specific Stab2-Cre driver mice to delete Wls from hepatic endothelial cells (HECs). The resultant Stab2-Cretg/wt ;Wlsfl/fl (Wls-HECKO) mice were viable, but showed a significantly reduced LW/BW. Specifically, ablation of angiocrine Wnt signaling impaired metabolic zonation in the liver, as shown by loss of pericentral, beta-catenin-dependent target genes such as glutamine synthase (Glul), RhBg, Axin2, and cytochrome P450 2E1, as well as by extended expression of periportal genes such as arginase 1. Furthermore, endothelial subtype-specific expression of a c-terminally YFP-tagged Wls fusion protein in Wls-HECKO mice (Stab2-Cretg/wt ;Wlsfl/fl ;Rosa26:Wls-YFPfl/wt [Wls-rescue]) restored metabolic liver zonation. Interestingly, lipid metabolism was altered in Wls-HECKO mice exhibiting significantly reduced plasma cholesterol levels, while maintaining normal plasma triglyceride and blood glucose concentrations. On the contrary, zonal expression of Endomucin, LYVE1, and other markers of HEC heterogeneity were not altered in Wls-HECKO livers.

30923916,Genetic variants in RPA1 associated with the response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is a commonly used first-line chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. Genetic variants in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway genes may alter genomic integrity and the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. METHODS: We investigated the association between genetic variants in 19 NER pathway genes and the disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) among 166 colorectal cancer patients who received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was performed using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal. Gene harboring significant SNP was overexpressed or knocked down to demonstrate the effect on cell phenotypes with or without oxaliplatin treatment. RESULTS: We found that rs5030740, located in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of RPA1, was associated with DCR [OR = 2.99 (1.33-5.69), P = 4.00 x 10-3] and PFS [HR = 1.86 (1.30-2.68), P = 7.39 x 10-4]. The C allele was significantly associated with higher RPA1 mRNA expression levels according to eQTL analysis (P = 0.010 for sigmoid colon and P = 0.004 for transverse colon). The C allele of rs5030740 disrupted let-7e-5p binding to enhance RPA1 expression. Functionally, RPA1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis, whereas RPA1 overexpression promoted proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. Furthermore, low RPA1 expression increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin in colon cancer cells and inhibited proliferation after oxaliplatin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate an association between rs5030740 and the DCR and PFS of colorectal cancer patients.

31428572,Mutation Spectrum of Cancer-Associated Genes in Patients With Early Onset of Colorectal Cancer.,"Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is rising worldwide, as well as in the Republic of Kazakhstan, while its occurrence is also increasing in the younger population. Hereditary forms associated with the development of colon and rectal cancer and early-onset CRC have never been studied in the population of Kazakhstan. The aim of this research was to investigate the spectrum of CRC-related gene mutations to determine which mutations cause early onset of CRC in the Kazakhstan population. Methods: The study included 125 unrelated patients from Kazakhstan (range 17-50 years in age) with early onset CRC. Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood of the patients. Next-generation sequencing was performed using the TruSightCancer Kit on the MiSeq platform. The Studio Variant was used to annotate and interpret genetic variants. Results: Bioinformatics analysis of Next-generation sequencing data revealed 11,152 variants from 85 genes, of them, 3,790 missense, 6,254 synonymous variants, 44 3'UTR variants, 10 frameshift variants, five stop-gain variants, four in-frame deletions, two splice donors, one splice acceptor variant, and 1,042 intron or non-coding variants. APC, BRCA2/1, ALK, BRIP1, EGFR, FANCA, FANCD2, FANCI, HNF1A, MEN1, NSD1, PMS2, RECQL4, RET, SLX4, WRN, and XPC genes mutated most often. According to the ACMG guidelines and LOVD/ClinVar databases, 24 variants were pathogenic (10 frameshifts, five missenses, five stop-gain, one in-frame deletion, and three splice-site mutations), and 289 were VUS with population frequency <1%, 131 of them were attributed as deleterious. In the study, 50% of all pathogenic mutations found in Kazakhstani patients with early CRC onset were identified in the subgroups with a family history of CRC and primary multiple tumors. In APC, pathogenic mutations were most often (21%). Conclusion: Pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations were found in 20 (16%) out of 125 patients. Eight novel pathogenic mutations detected in FANCI, APC, BMPR1, ATM, and DICER1 genes have not been reported in previous literature.

27935710,Quantification of ATP7B Protein in Dried Blood Spots by Peptide Immuno-SRM as a Potential Screen for Wilson's Disease.,"Wilson's Disease (WD), a copper transport disorder caused by a genetic defect in the ATP7B gene, has been a long time strong candidate for newborn screening (NBS), since early interventions can give better results by preventing irreversible neurological disability or liver cirrhosis. Several previous pilot studies measuring ceruloplasmin (CP) in infants or children showed that this marker alone was insufficient to meet the universal screening for WD. WD results from mutations that cause absent or markedly diminished levels of ATP7B. Therefore, ATP7B could serve as a marker for the screening of WD, if the protein can be detected from dried blood spots (DBS). This study demonstrates that the immuno-SRM platform can quantify ATP7B in DBS in the picomolar range, and that the assay readily distinguishes affected cases from normal controls (p < 0.0001). The assay precision was <10% CV, and the protein was stable for a week in DBS at room temperature.

38441724,Assessment of Autophagy in Leishmania Parasites.,"Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by numerous species of Leishmania parasites, including Leishmania major. The parasite is transmitted by several species of sandfly vectors and infects myeloid cells leading to a myriad of inflammatory responses, immune dysregulations, and disease manifestations. Every cell undergoes autophagy, a self-regulated degradative process that permits the cells to recycle damaged or worn-out organelles in order to maintain cellular health and homeostasis. Studies have shown that Leishmania modulates their host cell autophagic machinery and there are indications that the parasite-specific autophagic processes may be valuable for parasite virulence and survival. However, the role of autophagy in Leishmania is inconclusive because of the limited tools available to study the Leishmania-specific autophagic machinery. Here, we describe methods to study and definitively confirm autophagy in Leishmania major. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allowed us to visualize Leishmania autophagosomes, especially those containing damaged mitochondrial content, as well as dividing mitochondria with ongoing fusion/fission processes. Flow cytometry enabled us to identify the amount of acridine orange dye accumulating in the acidic vacuolar compartments in Leishmania major by detecting fluorescence in the red laser when autophagic inhibitors or enhancers were included.

31330830,The Molecular Hallmarks of the Serrated Pathway in Colorectal Cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. It includes different subtypes that differ in their clinical and prognostic features. In the past decade, in addition to the conventional adenoma-carcinoma model, an alternative multistep mechanism of carcinogenesis, namely the ""serrated pathway"", has been described. Approximately, 15 to 30% of all CRCs arise from neoplastic serrated polyps, a heterogeneous group of lesions that are histologically classified into three morphologic categories: hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated adenomas/polyps, and the traditional serrated adenomas/polyps. Serrated polyps are characterized by genetic (BRAF or KRAS mutations) and epigenetic (CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)) alterations that cooperate to initiate and drive malignant transformation from normal colon mucosa to polyps, and then to CRC. The high heterogeneity of the serrated lesions renders their diagnostic and pathological interpretation difficult. Hence, novel genetic and epigenetic biomarkers are required for better classification and management of CRCs. To date, several molecular alterations have been associated with the serrated polyp-CRC sequence. In addition, the gut microbiota is emerging as a contributor to/modulator of the serrated pathway.

38583503,Transcriptome and Metabolome analysis reveal HFPO-TA induced disorders of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in rat by interfering with PPAR signaling pathway.,"PFOA is one of the most representative compounds in the family of perfluorinated organic compounds. Due to its varying toxicity, alternatives to PFOA are beginning to emerge. HFPO-TA is an alternative for PFOA. It is currently unclear whether HFPO-TA affects glucose and lipid metabolism. In this study, rats were used as an animal model to investigate the effects of HFPO-TA on liver glucose and lipid metabolism. We found that HFPO-TA can affect glucose tolerance. Through omics analysis and molecular detection, it was found that HFPO-TA mainly affects the PPAR signaling pathway in the liver of rats, inhibiting liver glycolysis while promoting glucose production. HFPO-TA not only promotes the synthesis of fatty acids in the liver, but also promotes the breakdown of fatty acids, which ultimately leads to the disruption of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. The effects of HFPO-TA on metabolism are discussed in this paper to provide a reference for the risk assessment of this PFOA substitute.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\38583503.txt,0,"PFOA is one of the most representative compounds in the family of perfluorinated organic compounds.

30987226,Pathological and Molecular Features of Glioblastoma and Its Peritumoral Tissue.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and lethal human brain tumors. At present, GBMs are divided in primary and secondary on the basis of the mutational status of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes. In addition, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are considered crucial to better define the prognosis. Although primary and secondary GBMs are histologically indistinguishable, they retain distinct genetic alterations that account for different evolution of the tumor. The high invasiveness, the propensity to disperse throughout the brain parenchyma, and the elevated vascularity make these tumors extremely recidivist, resulting in a short patient median survival even after surgical resection and chemoradiotherapy. Furthermore, GBM is considered an immunologically cold tumor. Several studies highlight a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that promotes recurrence and poor prognosis. Deeper insight into the tumor immune microenvironment, together with the recent discovery of a conventional lymphatic system in the central nervous system (CNS), led to new immunotherapeutic strategies. In the last two decades, experimental evidence from different groups proved the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), also known as tumor-initiating cells, that may play an active role in tumor development and progression. Recent findings also indicated the presence of highly infiltrative CSCs in the peritumoral region of GBM. This region appears to play a key role in tumor growing and recurrence.

The most common fusion partner gene is BRD4, followed by BRD3 and NSD3. Recently, NUTM1 gene rearrangement has been identified in rare tumors from soft tissues, intracranial locations, and other visceral organs. These tumors often show high grade malignant epithelioid to round cell histomorphology and lack evidence of squamous and/or epithelial differentiation. Therefore, their relationship with classic NUT carcinoma is still uncertain. Here, we present a primary mandible bone tumor of a 21-year-old female exhibiting monotonous epithelioid and rhabdoid cytomorphology, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. The initial immunohistochemical workup was non-specific, showing only CD34 positivity while being negative for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), EMA, p63, etc. INI-1 expression was retained. RNA sequencing was performed and identified a rare ZNF532-NUTM1 gene fusion, which had only been reported in a single case of pulmonary NUT carcinoma. The fusion was confirmed by FISH for NUTM1 gene rearrangement and supported by diffuse and strong NUT immunoreactivity. MYC mRNA up-regulation and immunoreactivity, a common finding in NUT carcinoma, was also observed in this tumor, suggesting a possible common pathogenetic mechanism and potential treatment target.

Currently available treatment options are ineffective in the majority of affected infants and/or associated with potential serious side effects. Based on the assumption that mTOR overactivation results in increased neuroexcitability in TSC, mTOR inhibitors have been studied as antiseizure therapy. As a result, everolimus recently received approval for the adjunctive treatment of patients aged >=2 years with refractory TSC-associated focal and secondary generalized seizures. However, efficacy and safety data for infants with TSC-associated WS are still lacking. Therefore, a prospective open-label observational study was initiated at our center, to evaluate everolimus add-on treatment in infants with TSC-associated WS, previously refractory to standard treatment. For this preliminary report, data from four male infants with TSC2 and a median observation period of 13 (range = 8-42) months after treatment initiation were analyzed. Two infants showed electroclinical remission until day 14 after everolimus treatment initiation. In one additional infant, hypsarrhythmia resolved. No relapse after initial response was documented. Developmental progress improved in three infants. Tolerability was similar to that described in older children.

31083279,Oncogenic Effect of the Novel Fusion Gene VAPA-Rab31 in Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"Fusion genes have been identified as oncogenes in several solid tumors including lung, colorectal, and stomach cancers. Here, we characterized the fusion gene, VAPA-Rab31, discovered from RNA-sequencing data of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who did not harbor activating mutations in EGFR, KRAS and ALK. This fusion gene encodes a protein comprising the N-terminal region of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein A (VAPA) fused to the C-terminal region of Ras-related protein 31 (Rab31). Exogenous expression of VAPA-Rab31 in immortalized normal bronchial epithelial cells demonstrated the potential transforming effects of this fusion gene, including increased colony formation and cell proliferation in vitro. Also, enhanced tumorigenicity upon VAPA-Rab31 was confirmed in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. Metastatic tumors were also detected in the liver and lungs of xenografted mice. Overexpression of VAPA-Rab31 upregulated anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and phosphorylated CREB both in cells and xenograft tumors. Reduced apoptosis and increased phosphorylation of CREB and Erk were observed in VAPA-Rab31-overexpressing cells after bortezomib treatment. Elevated Bcl-2 level via activated CREB contributed to the resistance to the bortezomib-induced apoptosis.

30085095,Bioengineered PBGD variant improves the therapeutic index of gene therapy vectors for acute intermittent porphyria.,"A first-in-human gene therapy trial using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector for acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) reveals that higher doses would be required to reach therapeutic levels of the porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) transgene. We developed a hyperfunctional PBGD protein to improve the therapeutic index without increasing vector dose. A consensus protein sequence from 12 mammal species was compared to the human PBGD sequence, and eight amino acids were selected. I291M and N340S variants showed the highest increase in enzymatic activity when expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. In silico analysis indicates that isoleucine 291 to methionine and asparagine 340 to serine variants did not affect the active site of the enzyme. In vitro analysis indicated a synergistic interaction between these two substitutions that improve kinetic stability. Finally, full protection against a phenobarbital-induced attack was achieved in AIP mice after the administration of 1 x 1011 gc/kg of rAAV2/8-PBGD-I291M/N340S vector; three times lower than the dose required to achieve full protection with the control rAAV2/8-hPBGD vector.

Overexpression of SNW1 has been linked to adverse prognosis in different cancer types, but studies on the role of SNW1 in prostate cancer are lacking. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed SNW1 expression in 10,310 prostate cancers in a tissue microarray (TMA) with attached clinical and molecular data. RESULTS: The comparison with normal prostate tissue revealed an up regulation of SNW1 in a subset of cancer samples. SNW1 staining was considered weak in 31.5%, moderate in 37.7% and strong in 14% of cancers. Strong SNW1 expression was markedly more frequent in prostate cancers harboring the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (24%) than in ERG negative cancers (7%, p < 0.0001). Significant associations with Gleason grade, stage, nodal status and early biochemical recurrence were observed in the ERG negative and positive subset.

While immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) is beneficial, XLA patients remain at risk for infections, structural lung damage, and rarely, neoplasia. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) may offer a potential cure, but is associated with significant life-threatening complications. Here, we present a 25-year old XLA patient who developed pre-B acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) with somatic TP53 mutation, and treatment for this high-risk malignancy involved full myeloablative conditioning and a HLA-matched sibling alloSCT.

30188763,Suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by EGF receptor is required for hair follicle development.,"Mice that lack the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) fail to develop a hair coat, but the mechanism responsible for this deficit is not completely understood. Here, we show that EGFR plays a critical role to attenuate wingless-type MMTV integration site family member (Wnt)/beta-catenin signaling during postnatal hair follicle development. Genetic ablation of EGFR in mice resulted in increased mitotic activity in matrix cells, apoptosis in hair follicles, and impaired differentiation of epithelial lineages that form hair. EGFR is activated in wild-type hair follicle stem cells marked with SOX9 or NFATc1 and is essential to restrain proliferation and support stem cell numbers and their quiescence. We observed elevated levels of Wnt4, 6, 7b, 10a, 10b, and 16 transcripts and hyperactivation of the beta-catenin pathway in EGFR knockout follicles. Using primary keratinocytes, we linked ligand-induced EGFR activation to suppression of nascent mRNA synthesis of Wnt genes. Overexpression of the Wnt antagonist sFRP1 in mice lacking EGFR demonstrated that elevated Wnts are a major cause for the hair follicle defects. Colocalization of transforming growth factor alpha and Wnts regulated by EGFR in stem cells and progeny indicates that EGFR autocrine loops control Wnts.

In humans, CD3D, CD3E, and CD3Z gene defects are a cause of severe immune deficiency and present early in life with increased susceptibility to infections. By contrast, CD3G mutations lead to milder phenotypes, mainly characterized by autoimmunity. However, the role of CD3gamma in establishing and maintaining immune tolerance has not been elucidated. In this manuscript, we aimed to investigate abnormalities of T-cell repertoire and function in patients with genetic defects in CD3G associated with autoimmunity. High throughput sequencing was used to study composition and diversity of the T-cell receptor beta (TRB) repertoire in regulatory T cells (Tregs), conventional CD4+ (Tconv), and CD8+ T cells from 6 patients with CD3G mutations and healthy controls. Treg function was assessed by studying its ability to suppress proliferation of Tconv cells. Treg cells of patients with CD3G defects had reduced diversity, increased clonality, and reduced suppressive function. The TRB repertoire of Tconv cells from patients with CD3G deficiency was enriched for hydrophobic amino acids at positions 6 and 7 of the CDR3, a biomarker of self-reactivity.

26511139,Correlation between mutations and mRNA expression of APC and MUTYH genes: new insight into hereditary colorectal polyposis predisposition.,"BACKGROUND: Transcript dosage imbalance may influence the transcriptome. To gain insight into the role of altered gene expression in hereditary colorectal polyposis predisposition, in the present study we analyzed absolute and allele-specific expression (ASE) of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and mutY Homolog (MUTYH) genes. METHODS: We analyzed DNA and RNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 49 familial polyposis patients and 42 healthy blood donors selected according similar gender and age. Patients were studied for germline alterations in both genes using dHPLC, MLPA and automated sequencing. APC and MUTYH mRNA expression levels were investigated by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis using TaqMan assay and by ASE assays using dHPLC-based primer extension. RESULTS: Twenty out of 49 patients showed germline mutations: 14 in APC gene and six in MUTYH gene. Twenty-nine patients did not show mutations in both genes. Results from qRT-PCR indicated that gene expression of both APC and MUTYH was reduced in patients analyzed. In particular, a significant reduction in APC expression was observed in patients without APC germline mutation vs control group (P < 0.05) while APC expression in the mutation carrier patients, although lower compared to control individuals, did not show statistical significance. On the other hand a significant reduced MUTYH expression was detected in patients with MUTYH mutations vs control group (P < 0.05). Altered ASE of APC was detected in four out of eight APC mutation carriers. In particular one case showed a complete loss of one allele. Among APC mutation negative cases, 4 out of 13 showed a moderate ASE. ASE of MUTYH did not show any altered expression in the cases analyzed. Spearman's Rho Test analysis showed a positive and significant correlation between APC and MUTYH genes both in cases and in controls (P = 0.020 and P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: APC and MUTYH showed a reduced germline expression, not always corresponding to gene mutation. Expression of APC is decreased in mutation negative cases and this appears to be a promising indicator of FAP predisposition, while for MUTYH gene, mutation is associated to reduced mRNA expression.

This data suggested the rapid mucus penetration of the distended LNCs, despite their increased size, was a consequence of their capacity to take a less tortuous path through the barrier, i.e., they experienced less steric hinderance, compared to the non-distended LNC.",[],0
29885404,In situ analysis of mTORC1/2 and cellular metabolism-related proteins in human Lymphangioleiomyomatosis.,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare progressive cystic lung disease with features of a low-grade neoplasm. It is primarily caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Sirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), slows down disease progression in some, but not all patients. Hitherto, other potential therapeutic targets such as mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and various metabolic pathways have not been investigated in human LAM tissues. The aim of this study was to assess activities of mTORC1, mTORC2 and various metabolic pathways in human LAM tissues through analysis of protein expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of p-S6 (mTORC1 downstream protein), Rictor (mTORC2 scaffold protein) as well as GLUT1, GAPDH, ATPB, GLS, MCT1, ACSS2 and CPT1A (metabolic pathway markers) were performed on lung tissue from 11 patients with sporadic LAM. Immunoreactivity was assessed in LAM cells with bronchial smooth muscle cells as controls. Expression of p-S6, Rictor, GAPDH, GLS, MCT1, ACSS2 and CPT1A was significantly higher in LAM cells than in bronchial smooth muscle cells (P<.01). No significant differences were found between LAM cells and normal bronchial smooth muscle cells in GLUT1 and ATPB expression. The results are uniquely derived from human tissue and indicate that, in addition to mTORC1, mTORC2 may also play an important role in the pathobiology of LAM. Furthermore, glutaminolysis, acetate utilization and fatty acid beta-oxidation appear to be the preferred bioenergetic pathways in LAM cells. mTORC2 and these preferred bioenergetic pathways appear worthy of further study as they may represent possible therapeutic targets in the treatment of LAM.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\29885404.txt,0,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare progressive cystic lung disease with features of a low-grade neoplasm.

24694135,Computing global minimizers to a constrained B-spline image registration problem from optimal l1 perturbations to block match data.,"PURPOSE: Block matching is a well-known strategy for estimating corresponding voxel locations between a pair of images according to an image similarity metric. Though robust to issues such as image noise and large magnitude voxel displacements, the estimated point matches are not guaranteed to be spatially accurate. However, the underlying optimization problem solved by the block matching procedure is similar in structure to the class of optimization problem associated with B-spline based registration methods. By exploiting this relationship, the authors derive a numerical method for computing a global minimizer to a constrained B-spline registration problem that incorporates the robustness of block matching with the global smoothness properties inherent to B-spline parameterization. METHODS: The method reformulates the traditional B-spline registration problem as a basis pursuit problem describing the minimall1-perturbation to block match pairs required to produce a B-spline fitting error within a given tolerance. The sparsity pattern of the optimal perturbation then defines a voxel point cloud subset on which the B-spline fit is a global minimizer to a constrained variant of the B-spline registration problem. As opposed to traditional B-spline algorithms, the optimization step involving the actual image data is addressed by block matching. RESULTS: The performance of the method is measured in terms of spatial accuracy using ten inhale/exhale thoracic CT image pairs (available for download atwww.dir-lab.com) obtained from the COPDgene dataset and corresponding sets of expert-determined landmark point pairs. The results of the validation procedure demonstrate that the method can achieve a high spatial accuracy on a significantly complex image set. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methodology is demonstrated to achieve a high spatial accuracy and is generalizable in that in can employ any displacement field parameterization described as a least squares fit to block match generated estimates. Thus, the framework allows for a wide range of image similarity block match metric and physical modeling combinations.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\24694135.txt,0,"PURPOSE: Block matching is a well-known strategy for estimating corresponding voxel locations between a pair of images according to an image similarity metric.

31168756,High-Resolution Pharyngeal Manometry and Impedance: Protocols and Metrics-Recommendations of a High-Resolution Pharyngeal Manometry International Working Group.,"High-resolution manometry has traditionally been utilized in gastroenterology diagnostic clinical and research applications. Recently, it is also finding new and important applications in speech pathology and laryngology practices. A High-Resolution Pharyngeal Manometry International Working Group was formed as a grass roots effort to establish a consensus on methodology, protocol, and outcome metrics for high-resolution pharyngeal manometry (HRPM) with consideration of impedance as an adjunct modality. The Working Group undertook three tasks (1) survey what experts were currently doing in their clinical and/or research practice; (2) perform a review of the literature underpinning the value of particular HRPM metrics for understanding swallowing physiology and pathophysiology; and (3) establish a core outcomes set of HRPM metrics via a Delphi consensus process. Expert survey results were used to create a recommended HRPM protocol addressing system configuration, catheter insertion, and bolus administration. Ninety two articles were included in the final literature review resulting in categorization of 22 HRPM-impedance metrics into three classes: pharyngeal lumen occlusive pressures, hypopharyngeal intrabolus pressures, and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) function. A stable Delphi consensus was achieved for 8 HRPM-Impedance metrics: pharyngeal contractile integral (CI), velopharyngeal CI, hypopharyngeal CI, hypopharyngeal pressure at nadir impedance, UES integrated relaxation pressure, relaxation time, and maximum admittance. While some important unanswered questions remain, our work represents the first step in standardization of high-resolution pharyngeal manometry acquisition, measurement, and reporting. This could potentially inform future proposals for an HRPM-based classification system specifically for pharyngeal swallowing disorders.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\31168756.txt,0,"High-resolution manometry has traditionally been utilized in gastroenterology diagnostic clinical and research applications.

31414211,MYCN amplification drives an aggressive form of spinal ependymoma.,"Spinal ependymal tumors form a histologically and molecularly heterogeneous group of tumors with generally good prognosis. However, their treatment can be challenging if infiltration of the spinal cord or dissemination throughout the central nervous system (CNS) occurs and, in these cases, clinical outcome remains poor. Here, we describe a new and relatively rare subgroup of spinal ependymal tumors identified using DNA methylation profiling that is distinct from other molecular subgroups of ependymoma. Copy number variation plots derived from DNA methylation arrays showed MYCN amplification as a characteristic genetic alteration in all cases of our cohort (n = 13), which was subsequently validated using fluorescence in situ hybridization. The histological diagnosis was anaplastic ependymoma (WHO Grade III) in ten cases and classic ependymoma (WHO Grade II) in three cases. Histological re-evaluation in five primary tumors and seven relapses showed characteristic histological features of ependymoma, namely pseudorosettes, GFAP- and EMA positivity. Electron microscopy revealed cilia, complex intercellular junctions and intermediate filaments in a representative sample. Taking these findings into account, we suggest to designate this molecular subgroup spinal ependymoma with MYCN amplification, SP-EPN-MYCN. SP-EPN-MYCN tumors showed distinct growth patterns with intradural, extramedullary localization mostly within the thoracic and cervical spine, diffuse leptomeningeal spread throughout the whole CNS and infiltrative invasion of the spinal cord. Dissemination was observed in 100% of cases. Despite high-intensity treatment, SP-EPN-MYCN showed significantly worse median progression free survival (PFS) (17 months) and median overall survival (OS) (87 months) than all other previously described molecular spinal ependymoma subgroups. OS and PFS were similar to supratentorial ependymoma with RELA-fusion (ST-EPN-RELA) and posterior fossa ependymoma A (PF-EPN-A), further highlighting the aggressiveness of this distinct new subgroup. We, therefore, propose to establish SP-EPN-MYCN as a new molecular subgroup in ependymoma and advocate for testing newly diagnosed spinal ependymal tumors for MYCN amplification.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31414211.txt,1,"Spinal ependymal tumors form a histologically and molecularly heterogeneous group of tumors with generally good prognosis.

29146131,Dysregulation of autophagy in melanocytes contributes to hypopigmented macules in tuberous sclerosis complex.,"BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) gene mutations lead to constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, resulting in a broad range of symptoms. Hypopigmented macules are the earliest sign. Although we have already confirmed that topical rapamycin treatment (an mTOR inhibitor) protects patients with TSC against macular hypopigmentation, the pathogenesis of such lesions remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: Recently emerging evidence supports a role for autophagy in skin pigmentation. Herein, we investigated the impact of autophagic dysregulation on TSC-associated hypopigmentation. METHODS: Skin samples from 10 patients with TSC, each bearing characteristic hypopigmented macules, and 6 healthy donors were subjected to immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses. In addition, TSC2-knockdown (KD) was investigated in human epidermal melanocytes by melanin content examination, real-time PCR, western blotting analyses, and intracellular immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Activation of the mTOR signaling pathway decreased melanocytic pigmentation in hypopigmented macules of patients with TSC and in TSC2-KD melanocytes. In addition, LC3 expression (a marker of autophagy) and autophagosome counts increased, whereas, intracellular accumulation of autophagic degradative substrates (p62 and ubiquitinated proteins) was evident in TSC2-KD melanocytes. Furthermore, depigmentation in TSC2-KD melanocytes was accelerated by inhibiting autophagy (ATG7-KD or bafilomycin A1-pretreatment) and was completely reversed by induction of autophagy via mTOR-dependent (rapamycin) or mTOR-independent (SMER28) exposure. Finally, dysregulation of autophagy, marked by increased LC3 expression and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, was also observed in melanocytes of TSC-related hypopigmented macules.

26524254,Altered cerebellum development and impaired motor coordination in mice lacking the Btg1 gene: Involvement of cyclin D1.,"Cerebellar granule neurons develop postnatally from cerebellar granule precursors (GCPs), which are located in the external granule layer (EGL) where they massively proliferate. Thereafter, GCPs become postmitotic, migrate inward to form the internal granule layer (IGL), further differentiate and form synapses with Purkinje cell dendrites. We previously showed that the Btg family gene, Tis21/Btg2, is required for normal GCP migration. Here we investigated the role in cerebellar development of the related gene, Btg1, which regulates stem cell quiescence in adult neurogenic niches, and is expressed in the cerebellum. Knockout of Btg1 in mice caused a major increase of the proliferation of the GCPs in the EGL, whose thickness increased, remaining hyperplastic even after postnatal day 14, when the EGL is normally reduced to a few GCP layers. This was accompanied by a slight decrease of differentiation and migration of the GCPs and increase of apoptosis. The GCPs of double Btg1/Tis21-null mice presented combined major defects of proliferation and migration outside the EGL, indicating that each gene plays unique and crucial roles in cerebellar development. Remarkably, these developmental defects lead to a permanent increase of the adult cerebellar volume in Btg1-null and double mutant mice, and to impairment in all mutants, including Tis21-null, of the cerebellum-dependent motor coordination. Gain- and loss-of-function strategies in a GCP cell line revealed that Btg1 regulates the proliferation of GCPs selectively through cyclin D1.

31192927,Prolonged lumbosacral pain as the initial presentation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in an adult: A case report.,"RATIONALE: The differential diagnosis of conditions manifesting as bone and joint pain is complex. Although many individuals with acute leukemia experience bone pain, lumbosacral pain as an early feature of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is rare. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we report a case of an adult who presented with a 7-month history of persistent lumbosacral pain which had become more severe during the previous month. DIAGNOSES: Prior to referral, his full blood count revealed no abnormalities, and a computerized tomography scan revealed mild bone hyperplasia of his lumbar vertebrae, with disc herniations of L3-S1. His blood biochemistry and urinary test results had been normal. After referral to our clinic, tests of the morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biology of his bone marrow led to a diagnosis of MLL-AF4 fusion positive B-cell ALL. INTERVENTIONS: Prior to his referral, he had been treated with painkillers by local doctors. The painkillers initially provided pain relief, but their effect wore off over time. After diagnosis, he was started on an adult ALL chemotherapy protocol. OUTCOMES: His symptoms resolved within a week of starting chemotherapy. At his most recent assessment, 10 months after diagnosis, he was on maintenance chemotherapy and in remission.

Nine men who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of seroconversion and had sustained plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for at least 6 months were enrolled. Median age was 38 years, median pre-ART HIV-1 RNA was 140,000 copies/ml and mean baseline CD4 count was 755/mul. Two DNA, followed by 2 MVA, inoculations were given 8 weeks apart. Eight subjects completed all vaccinations and TI. Clinical and laboratory adverse events were generally mild, with no serious or grade 4 events. Only reactogenicity events were considered related to study drug. No treatment emergent viral resistance was seen.

30975761,Inherited predisposition to malignant mesothelioma and overall survival following platinum chemotherapy.,"Survival from malignant mesothelioma, particularly pleural mesothelioma, is very poor. For patients with breast, ovarian, or prostate cancers, overall survival is associated with increased sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy due to loss-of-function mutations in DNA repair genes. The goal of this project was to evaluate, in patients with malignant mesothelioma, the relationship between inherited loss-of-function mutations in DNA repair and other tumor suppressor genes and overall survival following platinum chemotherapy. Patients with histologically confirmed malignant mesothelioma were evaluated for inherited mutations in tumor suppressor genes. Survival was evaluated with respect to genotype and site of mesothelioma. Among 385 patients treated with platinum chemotherapy, median overall survival was significantly longer for patients with loss-of-function mutations in any of the targeted genes compared with patients with no such mutation (P = 0.0006). The effect of genotype was highly significant for patients with pleural mesothelioma (median survival 7.9 y versus 2.4 y, P = 0.0012), but not for patients with peritoneal mesothelioma (median survival 8.2 y versus 5.4 y, P = 0.47). Effect of patient genotype on overall survival, measured at 3 y, remained independently significant after adjusting for gender and age at diagnosis, two other known prognostic factors. Patients with pleural mesothelioma with inherited mutations in DNA repair and other tumor suppressor genes appear to particularly benefit from platinum chemotherapy compared with patients without inherited mutations.

30904095,The role of inherited genetic variants in colorectal polyposis syndromes.,"Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in women across the world. Most CRCs occur sporadically, but in 15-35% of cases, hereditary factors are important. Some patients with an inherited predisposition to CRC will be diagnosed with a ""genetic polyposis syndrome"" such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), polymerase proofreading associated polyposis (PPAP), NTHL1-associated polyposis, MSH3-associated polyposis or a hamartomatous polyposis syndrome. Individuals with >=10 colorectal polyps have traditionally been referred for genetic diagnostic testing to identify APC and MUTYH mutations which cause FAP and MAP respectively. Mutations are found in most patients with >100 adenomas but in only a minority of those with 10-100 adenomas. The reasons that diagnostic laboratories are not identifying pathogenic variants include mutations occurring outside of the open reading frames of genes, individuals exhibiting generalized mosaicism and the involvement of additional genes.

The dataset for the reporting of renal biopsy for tumour is designed to provide a structured reporting template containing minimum data recording key elements suitable for international use. In formulating the dataset, the ICCR panel incorporated recommendations from the 2012 Vancouver Consensus Conference of the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) and the 2016 edition of the WHO Bluebook on tumours of the urinary and male genital systems. Reporting elements were divided into Required (Core) and Recommended (Non-core) components of the report. Required elements are as follows: specimen laterality, histological tumour type, WHO/ISUP histological tumour grade, sarcomatoid morphology, rhabdoid morphology, necrosis, lymphovascular invasion and coexisting pathology in non-neoplastic kidney. Recommended reporting elements are as follows: operative procedure, tumour site(s), histological tumour subtype and details of ancillary studies. In particular, it is noted that fluorescence in situ hybridisation studies may assist in diagnosing translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and in distinguishing oncocytoma and eosinophilic chromophobe RCC. It is anticipated that the implementation of this dataset into routine clinical practice will facilitate uniformity of pathology reporting worldwide.

Recent studies have identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRB) gene mutations in a subset of myofibromas, myopericytomas, and myopericytomatoses but not in angioleiomyomas. NOTCH receptor 3 (NOTCH3) mutations have been reported in a subset of infantile myofibromatosis. To assess their potential role in classifying pericytic tumors, we investigated PDGFRB and NOTCH3 mutations in 41 pericytic tumors of variable morphology, including some combined forms.

29298625,Initial romiplostim dosing and time to platelet response in patients with treatment refractory immune thrombocytopenia.,"BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: Romiplostim is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist recommended as a second-line therapy for immune thrombocytopenia. An initial dose of 1 mcg/kg/week subcutaneously with weekly 1 mcg/kg dose escalation is recommended per package labeling. Optimizing romiplostim dosing for hospitalized, corticosteroid- and intravenous immunoglobulin-refractory patients with severe thrombocytopenia secondary to immune thrombocytopenia may be critical for improving platelet responses, reducing the risk of bleeding, and decreasing hospital length of stay. Limited data are available evaluating the efficacy and safety of higher initial doses. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to compare the time to platelet >= 10 x 109/L between patients who received an initial romiplostim dose of >=2 mcg/kg/week compared to the standard initial dose of 1 mcg/kg/week. Secondary objectives included time to platelet response >= 30 x 109/L and >=50 x 109/L, percentage of patients achieving platelet responses, hospital length of stay, and incidence of adverse events and bleeding complications. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, cohort study including hospitalized adults with corticosteroid- and intravenous immunoglobulin-refractory immune thrombocytopenia. A baseline platelet < 10 x 109/L was required. Patients were stratified by their initial romiplostim dose into Cohort 1 (1 mcg/kg/week) and Cohort 2 (>=2 mcg/kg/week). A review of electronic medical records and descriptive statistics generated findings. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients were included, 4 in Cohort 1 and 14 in Cohort 2. Patients in Cohort 2 had a median initial dose of 4.5 mcg/kg/week. Patients in Cohort 2 achieved a platelet >= 10 x 109/L in a median of 2 days versus 4.5 days for Cohort 1. More patients in Cohort 2 achieved a platelet >= 30 x 109/L (42.9% vs. 25%) and platelet >= 50 x 109/L (28.6% vs. 25%). The median hospital length of stay was shorter in Cohort 2 (13.5 vs. 20 days). Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was noted less frequently in Cohort 2 (28.6% vs. 75%), while major bleeding was more frequent in Cohort 2 (14.3% vs. 0%). No thrombotic events occurred.

Recently, we found that purified anti-CD4 autoantibodies from the plasma of chronic HIV-1-infected patients under viral-suppressed antiretroviral therapy (ART) play a pathologic role in poor CD4+ T cell recovery. The purpose of the study was to investigate the association of systemic microbiome and anti-CD4 autoantibody production in HIV. Plasma microbiome from 12 healthy controls and 22 HIV-infected subjects under viral-suppressed ART were analyzed by MiSeq sequencing. Plasma level of autoantibodies and microbial translocation (LPS, total bacterial 16S rDNA, soluble CD14, and LPS binding protein) were analyzed by ELISA, limulus amebocyte assay, and qPCR. We found that plasma level of anti-CD4 IgGs but not anti-CD8 IgGs was increased in HIV+ subjects compared to healthy controls. HIV+ subjects with plasma anti-CD4 IgG > 50 ng/mL (high) had reduced microbial diversity compared to HIV+ subjects with anti-CD4 IgG <= 50 ng/mL (low). Moreover, plasma anti-CD4 IgG level was associated with elevated microbial translocation and reduced microbial diversity in HIV+ subjects. The Alphaproteobacteria class was significantly enriched in HIV+ subjects with low anti-CD4 IgG compared to patients with high anti-CD4 IgG even after controlling for false discovery rate (FDR). The microbial components were different from the phylum to genus level in HIV+ subjects with high anti-CD4 IgGs compared to the other two groups, but these differences were not significant after controlling for FDR.

31481959,A Novel BTK Gene Mutation in a Child With Atypical X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia and Recurrent Hemophagocytosis: A Case Report.,"X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), caused by a mutation in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene, is rarely reported in patients with recurrent hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This mutation leads to significantly reduced numbers of circulatory B cells and serum immunoglobulins in patients. Therefore, they exhibit repetitive bacterial infections since infancy, and immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy is the primary treatment. HLH is a life-threatening condition with manifestations of non-remitting fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, coagulopathy, lipid disorder, and multiple organ failure. It is caused by the immune dysregulation between cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and histiocytes. The treatment is based on HLH-2004 protocol including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, supportive therapy, and stem cell transplantation. However, as we know more about the classification and pathophysiology of HLH, the treatment is modified.

This mutation leads to significantly reduced numbers of circulatory B cells and serum immunoglobulins in patients. Therefore, they exhibit repetitive bacterial infections since infancy, and immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy is the primary treatment. HLH is a life-threatening condition with manifestations of non-remitting fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, coagulopathy, lipid disorder, and multiple organ failure. It is caused by the immune dysregulation between cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and histiocytes. The treatment is based on HLH-2004 protocol including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, supportive therapy, and stem cell transplantation.

29712894,Increased proteasomal activity supports photoreceptor survival in inherited retinal degeneration.,"Inherited retinal degenerations, affecting more than 2 million people worldwide, are caused by mutations in over 200 genes. This suggests that the most efficient therapeutic strategies would be mutation independent, i.e., targeting common pathological conditions arising from many disease-causing mutations. Previous studies revealed that one such condition is an insufficiency of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to process misfolded or mistargeted proteins in affected photoreceptor cells. We now report that retinal degeneration in mice can be significantly delayed by increasing photoreceptor proteasomal activity. The largest effect is observed upon overexpression of the 11S proteasome cap subunit, PA28alpha, which enhanced ubiquitin-independent protein degradation in photoreceptors. Applying this strategy to mice bearing one copy of the P23H rhodopsin mutant, a mutation frequently encountered in human patients, quadruples the number of surviving photoreceptors in the inferior retina of 6-month-old mice. This striking therapeutic effect demonstrates that proteasomes are an attractive target for fighting inherited blindness.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\29712894.txt,0,"Inherited retinal degenerations, affecting more than 2 million people worldwide, are caused by mutations in over 200 genes.

38539243,"A systematic review of progranulin concentrations in biofluids in over 7,000 people-assessing the pathogenicity of GRN mutations and other influencing factors.","Pathogenic heterozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are a key cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), leading to significantly reduced biofluid concentrations of the progranulin protein (PGRN). This has led to a number of ongoing therapeutic trials aiming to treat this form of FTD by increasing PGRN levels in mutation carriers. However, we currently lack a complete understanding of factors that affect PGRN levels and potential variation in measurement methods. Here, we aimed to address this gap in knowledge by systematically reviewing published literature on biofluid PGRN concentrations.
Published data including biofluid PGRN concentration, age, sex, diagnosis and GRN mutation were collected for 7071 individuals from 75 publications. The majority of analyses (72%) had focused on plasma PGRN concentrations, with many of these (56%) measured with a single assay type (Adipogen) and so the influence of mutation type, age at onset, sex, and diagnosis were investigated in this subset of the data.
We established a plasma PGRN concentration cut-off between pathogenic mutation carriers and non-carriers of 74.8 ng/mL using the Adipogen assay based on 3301 individuals, with a CSF concentration cut-off of 3.43 ng/mL. Plasma PGRN concentration varied by GRN mutation type as well as by clinical diagnosis in those without a GRN mutation. Plasma PGRN concentration was significantly higher in women than men in GRN mutation carriers (p = 0.007) with a trend in non-carriers (p = 0.062), and there was a significant but weak positive correlation with age in both GRN mutation carriers and non-carriers. No significant association was seen with weight or with TMEM106B rs1990622 genotype. However, higher plasma PGRN levels were seen in those with the GRN rs5848 CC genotype in both GRN mutation carriers and non-carriers.
These results further support the usefulness of PGRN concentration for the identification of the large majority of pathogenic mutations in the GRN gene.

Considering an immunomodulatory role of these polymorphisms, we genotyped 785 early breast cancer patients and correlated caspase 8 variants with disease-free survival (DFS) and the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Early breast cancer specimens were collected as part of the multicenter prospective PiA study. Genotyping was performed by pyrosequencing, TILs status was assessed using hematoxylin & eosin staining. The CASP8 -652Del variant was significantly associated with improved DFS in an allele-dose dependent manner (p = 0.027). Homozygosity for the -652Del variant was an independent predictor for improved DFS (HR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.174-0.726; p = 0.005).

31026806,Transcription Factor STAT3 Serves as a Negative Regulator Controlling IgE Class Switching in Mice.,"A mutation in STAT3 has been linked to the incidence of autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome, a disease characterized by elevated serum IgE Ab. However, how this genetic mutation leads to the phenotype has not been fully understood. We investigated the specific role of STAT3 in the germinal center (GC) B cells and plasma cells for IgE class switching. Through the use of STAT3 conditional knockout (cKO) mice in a Th2-type immunization model, we demonstrated that CD2-Cre-driven STAT3 cKO mice showed elevated IgE and decreased IgG1 in the serum and a reduction in GC formation. Within the GC, IgG1 + GC B cells were decreased, whereas IgE+ GC B cells were more prevalent. Additionally, these mice exhibited reduced IgG1 and elevated IgE populations of Ab-producing plasma cells. Subsequent experiments using a CD19-Cre cKO mouse established this effect to be B cell-intrinsic. Transcription factors critical for GC and plasma cell differentiation, including Bcl-6 and Aicda, were shown to function as downstream signals of STAT3 regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis revealed that many genes, including Bcl3 and Crtc2, were among the direct STAT3 regulated targets. Mice with STAT3 deficiency in B cells also demonstrated an increase in lung inflammation when used in an asthma-like disease model.

To discover novel loci harboring common variants associated with HbA1c in East Asians, we conducted a meta-analysis of 13 genome-wide association studies (GWAS; N = 21,026). We replicated our findings in three additional studies comprising 11,576 individuals of East Asian ancestry. Ten variants showed associations that reached genome-wide significance in the discovery data set, of which nine (four novel variants at TMEM79 [P value = 1.3 x 10(-23)], HBS1L/MYB [8.5 x 10(-15)], MYO9B [9.0 x 10(-12)], and CYBA [1.1 x 10(-8)] as well as five variants at loci that had been previously identified [CDKAL1, G6PC2/ABCB11, GCK, ANK1, and FN3KI]) showed consistent evidence of association in replication data sets. These variants explained 1.76% of the variance in HbA1c. Several of these variants (TMEM79, HBS1L/MYB, CYBA, MYO9B, ANK1, and FN3K) showed no association with either blood glucose or type 2 diabetes.

38189053,Causal association of immune cells and polycystic ovarian syndrome: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive disorder that affects a considerable number of women worldwide. It is accompanied by irregular menstruation, hyperandrogenism, metabolic abnormalities, reproductive disorders and other clinical symptoms, which seriously endangers women's physical and mental health. The etiology and pathogenesis of PCOS are not completely clear, but it is hypothesized that immune system may play a key role in it. However, previous studies investigating the connection between immune cells and PCOS have produced conflicting results.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful study design that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to enable examination of the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in observational data. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive two-sample MR analysis to examine the causal link between 731 immune cells and PCOS. We employed complementary MR methods, such as the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, and conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate the reliability of the outcomes.
Four immunophenotypes were identified to be significantly associated with PCOS risk: Memory B cell AC (IVW: OR [95%]: 1.123[1.040 to 1.213], <i>p</i> = 0.003), CD39+ CD4+ %CD4+ (IVW: OR [95%]: 0.869[0.784 to 0.963], <i>p</i> = 0.008), CD20 on CD20- CD38-(IVW: OR [95%]:1.297[1.088 to 1.546], <i>p</i> = 0.004), and HLA DR on CD14- CD16+ monocyte (IVW: OR [95%]:1.225[1.074 to 1.397], <i>p</i> = 0.003).

28784848,Cutting Edge: IL-2-Induced Expression of the Amino Acid Transporters SLC1A5 and CD98 Is a Prerequisite for NKG2D-Mediated Activation of Human NK Cells.,"Priming of human NK cells with IL-2 is necessary to render them functionally competent upon NKG2D engagement. We examined the underlying mechanisms that control NKG2D responsiveness in NK cells and found that IL-2 upregulates expression of the amino acid transporters SLC1A5 and CD98. Using specific inhibitors to block SLC1A5 and CD98 function, we found that production of IFN-gamma and degranulation by CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells following NKG2D stimulation were dependent on both transporters. IL-2 priming increased the activity of mTORC1, and inhibition of mTORC1 abrogated the ability of the IL-2-primed NK cells to produce IFN-gamma in response to NKG2D-mediated stimulation.

Paraffin-embedded tumour samples of women with high-risk EC (HR-EC) from the PORTEC-3 trial (n = 424), and a Dutch prospective clinical cohort called MST (n = 256), were used. All cases were molecularly classified. Expression of L1CAM, ER and PR were analysed by whole-slide immunohistochemistry and CTNNB1 mutations were assessed with a next-generation sequencing. Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank tests and Cox's proportional hazard models were used for survival analysis.
In total, 648 HR-EC were included. No independent prognostic value of ER, PR, L1CAM, and CTNNB1 was found, while age, stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy had an independent impact on risk of recurrence.

31043608,Capicua regulates neural stem cell proliferation and lineage specification through control of Ets factors.,"Capicua (Cic) is a transcriptional repressor mutated in the brain cancer oligodendroglioma. Despite its cancer link, little is known of Cic's function in the brain. We show that nuclear Cic expression is strongest in astrocytes and neurons but weaker in stem cells and oligodendroglial lineage cells. Using a new conditional Cic knockout mouse, we demonstrate that forebrain-specific Cic deletion increases proliferation and self-renewal of neural stem cells. Furthermore, Cic loss biases neural stem cells toward glial lineage selection, expanding the pool of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). These proliferation and lineage effects are dependent on de-repression of Ets transcription factors. In patient-derived oligodendroglioma cells, CIC re-expression or ETV5 blockade decreases lineage bias, proliferation, self-renewal, and tumorigenicity. Our results identify Cic as an important regulator of cell fate in neurodevelopment and oligodendroglioma, and suggest that its loss contributes to oligodendroglioma by promoting proliferation and an OPC-like identity via Ets overactivity.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31043608.txt,1,"Capicua (Cic) is a transcriptional repressor mutated in the brain cancer oligodendroglioma.

38501195,Rapid measurement of hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation by leveraging Bohr effect and Soret band bathochromic shift.,"Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) binds to hemoglobin (Hb) in the lungs and is then released (dissociated) in the tissues. The Bohr effect is a physiological mechanism that governs the affinity of Hb for O<sub>2</sub> based on pH, where a lower pH results in a lower Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity and higher Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation. Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity and dissociation are crucial for maintaining aerobic metabolism in cells and tissues. Despite its vital role in human physiology, Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement is underutilized in basic research and in clinical laboratories, primarily due to the technical complexity and limited throughput of existing methods. We present a rapid Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement approach by leveraging the Bohr effect and detecting the optical shift in the Soret band that corresponds to the light absorption by the heme group in Hb. This new method reduces Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement time from hours to minutes. We show that Hb deoxygenation can be accelerated chemically at the optimal pH of 6.9. We show that time and pH-controlled deoxygenation of Hb results in rapid and distinct conformational changes in its tertiary structure. These molecular conformational changes are manifested as significant, detectable shifts in Hb's optical absorption spectrum, particularly in the characteristic Soret band (414 nm). We extensively validated the method by testing human blood samples containing normal Hb and Hb variants. We show that rapid Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation can be used to screen for and detect Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity disorders and to evaluate the function and efficacy of Hb-modifying therapies. The ubiquity of optical absorption spectrophotometers positions this approach as an accessible, rapid, and accurate Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement method for basic research and clinical use.

YAP, a critical effector of the Hippo pathway, has been shown to contribute to the progression, metastasis and invasion of cancers. However, the potential role of YAP in mediating drug resistance remains obscure. METHODS: RT-qPCR and western blot were used to assess YAP expression in HCC cell lines. CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry, a xenograft tumour model, immunochemistry and GFP-mRFP-LC3 fusion proteins were utilized to evaluate the effect of YAP on multi-drug resistance, intracellular ROS production and the autophagy of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Autophagy inhibitor and rescue experiments were carried out to elucidate the mechanism by which YAP promotes chemoresistance in HCC cells. RESULTS: We found that BEL/FU, a typical HCC cell line with chemoresistance, exhibited overexpression of YAP. Moreover, the inhibition of YAP by shRNA or verteporfin conferred the sensitivity of BEL/FU cells to chemotherapeutic agents through autophagy-related cell death in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YAP silencing significantly enhanced autophagic flux by increasing RAC1-driven ROS, which contributed to the inactivation of mTOR in HCC cells. In addition, the antagonist of autophagy reversed the enhanced effect of YAP silencing on cell death under treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.

28813671,OCT4 and SOX2 Work as Transcriptional Activators in Reprogramming Human Fibroblasts.,"SOX2 and OCT4, in conjunction with KLF4 and cMYC, are sufficient to reprogram human fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), but it is unclear if they function as transcriptional activators or as repressors. We now show that, like OCT4, SOX2 functions as a transcriptional activator. We substituted SOX2-VP16 (a strong activator) for wild-type (WT) SOX2, and we saw an increase in the efficiency and rate of reprogramming, whereas the SOX2-HP1 fusion (a strong repressor) eliminated reprogramming. We report that, at an early stage of reprogramming, virtually all DNA-bound OCT4, SOX2, and SOX2-VP16 were embedded in putative enhancers, about half of which were created de novo. Those associated with SOX2-VP16 were, on average, stronger than those bearing WT SOX2. Many newly created putative enhancers were transient, and many transcription factor locations on DNA changed as reprogramming progressed. These results are consistent with the idea that, during reprogramming, there is an intermediate state that is distinct from both parental cells and iPSCs.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\28813671.txt,0,"SOX2 and OCT4, in conjunction with KLF4 and cMYC, are sufficient to reprogram human fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), but it is unclear if they function as transcriptional activators or as repressors.

However, the associations between levels of different T cell subsets and breast cancer molecular subtypes as well as other prognostic factors have not been fully established yet. We performed immunohistochemistry for CD8 (cytotoxic T cells (CTL)), FOXP3 (regulatory T cells (Tregs)), and GATA3 (Th2 cells) in 106 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded invasive breast cancer tissue samples and analyzed both the numbers and percentages of investigated cells in tumor-associated infiltrates. We observed that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2+ non-luminal breast tumors were associated with more numerous CTLs and Tregs and a higher Treg/Th2 cell ratio as compared with luminal A subtype. A higher Treg percentage was related to a decreased hormone receptor expression, an increase in the Ki67 level, a greater tumor size of luminal tumors, and the presence of lymph node metastases. Moreover, differences in the composition of T cell infiltrates were associated with HER2 status and histologic grade and type, and a distinct immune pattern was observed in tumors of different phenotypes regarding pT stage and nodal status.

A monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome with aberrant mast cells (MC) at extracutaneous sites has been described in patients with severe hypotension or anaphylaxis. METHODS: As MC in patients with elevated sBT might be altered in the skin as well, we studied MC in normal neck skin in anaphylaxis and urticaria patients with elevated sBT. RESULTS: A mean of 93.1 (SD 19.1) MC/mm2 was counted in normal neck skin in 14 patients with anaphylaxis, 84.0 (SD 13.6) in seven patients with urticaria, 142.0 (SD 24.0) in two patients with eczema, 124.4 (SD 43.2) in five patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) in comparison with autopsy skin (39.1 MC/mm2, SD 12.4).

30968154,Diverse and cancer type-specific roles of the p53 R248Q gain-of-function mutation in cancer migration and invasiveness.,"Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the TP53 gene lead to acquisition of new functions by the mutated tumor suppressor p53 protein. A number of the over-represented 'hot spot' mutations, including the ones in codons 175, 248 or 273, convey GOF phenotypes. Such phenotypes may include resistance to chemotherapeutics or changes in motility and invasiveness. Whereas the prevalent notion is that the acquisition of the p53 GOF phenotype translates into poorer prognosis for the patient, the analysis of a human somatic p53 mutations dataset demonstrated earlier tumor onset, but decreased frequency and altered location of metastases in patients with the p53-R248Q allele. Therefore, the GOF activities of p53-R248Q and p53-D281G were analyzed in triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cell lines with regard to invasive and metastatic traits. The expression of p53-D281G increased the motility and invasiveness of the lung cancer cells, but not those of the breast cancer cells. In contrast, the expression of p53-R248Q decreased the motility and invasiveness of the breast and lung cancer cells in a p53 transactivation-dependent manner. The intravenous xenotransplantation of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing p53-R248Q into zebrafish embryos resulted in an alteration of the distribution of cancer cells in the body of the fish. In p53-R248Q-expressing H1299 cells a decrease in the expression of TCF8/ZEB1 and N-cadherin was observed, suggesting partial mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition.

However, the true impact of these tests on surgical practice has not been demonstrated. This study examines the usefulness of molecular testing on surgical management decisions in patients referred for thyroid surgery at a tertiary care center. METHODS: Clinical information was collected from patients who presented to Johns Hopkins Hospital for surgical consultation regarding a thyroid nodule and who underwent molecular testing between August 2009 and March 2013. Tests included an RNA-based gene expression classifier, a DNA-based somatic mutation panel, BRAF, NRAS, and/or RET/PTC translocation. A surgical management algorithm was created by consensus of four thyroid surgeons. Postsurgical pathology analysis in each case was then used to judge the appropriateness of the surgical decision-making and the usefulness of preoperative molecular testing, in guiding surgical planning. RESULTS: Of 114 patients assessed by preoperative molecular testing, 87 (72 %) underwent surgery. Surgical management was altered in nine (10 %) patients on the basis of molecular testing. Of these, surgical management change was appropriate, relative to the postoperative pathology analysis, for three patients and inappropriate for six patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, molecular testing of thyroid nodule did not alter the surgical management of the majority of patients with thyroid nodules.

To assess the cost-effectiveness of surveillance, as compared to no surveillance.
In 2000, a surveillance program was initiated at Leiden University Medical Center with annual MRI and optional endoscopic ultrasound. Data were collected on the resection rate of screen-detected tumors and on survival. The Kaplan-Meier method and a parametric cure model were used to analyze and compare survival. Based on the surveillance and survival data from the screening program, a state-transition model was constructed to estimate lifelong outcomes.
A total of 347 mutation carriers participated in the surveillance program. PDAC was detected in 31 patients (8.9%) and the tumor could be resected in 22 patients (71.0%). Long-term cure among patients with resected PDAC was estimated at 47.1% (p < 0.001).

28951535,Dimerization of the adaptor Gads facilitates antigen receptor signaling by promoting the cooperative binding of Gads to the adaptor LAT.,"The accurate assembly of signalosomes centered on the adaptor protein LAT (linker of activated T cells) is required for antigen receptor signaling in T cells and mast cells. During signalosome assembly, members of the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) family of cytosolic adaptor proteins bind cooperatively to LAT through interactions with its phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) residues. We demonstrated the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-mediated dimerization of the Grb2 family member, Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (Gads). Gads dimerization was mediated by an SH2 domain interface, which is distinct from the pTyr binding pocket and which promoted cooperative, preferential binding of paired Gads to LAT. This SH2 domain-intrinsic mechanism of cooperativity, which we quantified by mathematical modeling, enabled Gads to discriminate between dually and singly phosphorylated LAT molecules. Mutational inactivation of the dimerization interface reduced cooperativity and abrogated Gads signaling in T cells and mast cells. The dimerization-dependent, cooperative binding of Gads to LAT may increase antigen receptor sensitivity by reducing signalosome formation at incompletely phosphorylated LAT molecules, thereby prioritizing the formation of complete signalosomes.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\28951535.txt,0,"The accurate assembly of signalosomes centered on the adaptor protein LAT (linker of activated T cells) is required for antigen receptor signaling in T cells and mast cells.

31026246,Impact of initial stage on metastatic melanoma survival.,"Patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma have varied clinical courses, even in patients with similar disease characteristics. We examine the impact of initial stage of melanoma diagnosis, BRAF status of primary melanoma, and receiving adjuvant therapy on postmetastatic overall survival (pmOS). We studied melanoma patients presenting to Perlmutter Cancer Center at New York University and prospectively enrolled in New York University melanoma biospecimen database and followed up on protocol-driven schedule. Patients were stratified by stage at initial melanoma diagnosis as per AJCC 7th ed. guidelines. pmOS was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazards models were used to assess hazard ratios (HRs). Three hundred and four out of 3204 patients developed metastatic disease over the time of follow-up (median follow-up 2.2 years, range: 0.08-35.2 years). Patients diagnosed with stage I (n=96) melanoma had longer pmOS (29.5 months) than those diagnosed with stage II (n=99, pmOS 14.9 months) or stage III (n=109, pmOS 15.1 months) melanoma (P=0.036). Initial stage of diagnosis remained significant in multivariate analysis when controlling for lactate dehydrogenase and site of metastases [primary diagnosis stage II (HR 1.44, P=0.046), stage III (HR 1.5, P=0.019)]. Adjuvant treatment was associated with better survival but BRAF mutation status did not show an association. Our data challenge the general assumption that primary melanomas converge upon diagnosis of metastatic disease and behave uniformly. Primary stage of melanoma at the time of diagnosis may be prognostic of outcome, similar to lactate dehydrogenase and metastatic disease sites.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31026246.txt,1,"Patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma have varied clinical courses, even in patients with similar disease characteristics.
