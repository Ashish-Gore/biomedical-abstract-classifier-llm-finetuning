27215853,Telomere-associated aging disorders.,"Telomeres are dynamic nucleoprotein-DNA structures that cap and protect linear chromosome ends. Several monogenic inherited diseases that display features of human premature aging correlate with shortened telomeres, and are referred to collectively as telomeropathies. These disorders have overlapping symptoms and a common underlying mechanism of telomere dysfunction, but also exhibit variable symptoms and age of onset, suggesting they fall along a spectrum of disorders. Primary telomeropathies are caused by defects in the telomere maintenance machinery, whereas secondary telomeropathies have some overlapping symptoms with primary telomeropathies, but are generally caused by mutations in DNA repair proteins that contribute to telomere preservation. Here we review both the primary and secondary telomeropathies, discuss potential mechanisms for tissue specificity and age of onset, and highlight outstanding questions in the field and future directions toward elucidating disease etiology and developing therapeutic strategies.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\27215853.txt,0,"Telomeres are dynamic nucleoprotein-DNA structures that cap and protect linear chromosome ends.

26586230,Diverse Cutaneous Presentations of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis in Children: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease, frequently affecting young children. PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective study in patients younger than 16 years old manifesting with skin symptoms, and documented their different cutaneous lesions and systemic symptoms. We compared subgroups of children with single-system, skin-only, and multisystem disease and sought signs predictive for multisystem disease. In a small sample of patients, BRAF mutations were analyzed in archived biopsies. RESULTS: A wide spectrum of cutaneous presentations varying from crusted nodules and papules, blisters, vascular tumor-like lesions, scaling orange to red macules (frequently in seborrheic regions) to purpuric macules, and papules was documented in our cohort of 32 children. Otitis externa was a common manifestation and mucosal lesions were seen in three patients. A novel manifestation was a red-blue nodule that appeared in a patient after a vaccination. None of the cutaneous lesions was predictive for the classification or final outcome as a single-system or multisystem disease. However, later onset and a more protracted course of skin lesions were more frequent findings in multisystem LCH. Mucosal lesions and otitis externa were almost exclusively seen in patients with multisystem disease, a finding that warrants further investigation. Both wild-type (WT) and mutated BRAF were found not only in multisystem LCH, but also in skin-only LCH. Two cases with rapidly resolving congenital lesions had WT BRAF.

26099230,Vertical extraventricular functional hemispherotomy: a new variant for hemispheric disconnection. Technical notes and results in three patients.,"PURPOSE: Hemispherectomy and disconnective hemispherotomy are the most effective epilepsy surgical procedures for the treatment of epilepsy due to hemispheric pathologies such as Sturge-Weber syndrome, diffuse hemispheric cortical dysplasia, and posttraumatic and postischemic focal lesions. Disconnective hemispherotomy is nowadays preferred to reduce surgical morbidity in term of early and late complications (i.e., cerebral superficial hemosiderosis). Despite the number of existing technical variants conceived to further reduce the amount of brain tissue to be removed, postoperative hydrocephalus still persists and may account for an average incidence of 15-41% according to different series and reviews. A new variant of disconnective vertical hemispherotomy we termed vertical extraventricular parasagittal hemispherotomy is described aiming to further reduce the amount of removed brain tissue and so the risk of postoperative hydrocephalus in favor of a pure hemispheric disconnection. METHODS: Three patients affected by drug-resistant epilepsy due to different hemispheric pathologies (posttraumatic epilepsy, Sturge-Weber syndrome, diffuse hemispheric cortical dysplasia) were considered to be candidates for vertical extraventricular parasagittal hemispherotomy disconnective based on presurgical evaluation protocol. The oldest patient was 15 years old, the two youngest were both 2 years old. RESULTS: None of the patients experienced early and late surgical complications. After a mean follow-up of 36 months (range 12-60 months), two patients were seizure free, one relapsed seizures 18 months later. Postoperative hydrocephalus never occurred. CONCLUSION: Vertical extraventricular parasagittal hemispherotomy may be an efficacious and less invasive technique as it consists in a pure disconnection of the hemisphere with less amount of brain tissue removed and a theoretical reduced risk of postoperative hydrocephalus.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\26099230.txt,0,"PURPOSE: Hemispherectomy and disconnective hemispherotomy are the most effective epilepsy surgical procedures for the treatment of epilepsy due to hemispheric pathologies such as Sturge-Weber syndrome, diffuse hemispheric cortical dysplasia, and posttraumatic and postischemic focal lesions.

30875581,Aggressive variants of prostate cancer - Are we ready to apply specific treatment right now?,"Recently, adoption of novel drugs for systemic treatment of metastatic prostate cancer has led to a striking improvement of response rate and survival in both hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant disease. In most cases, prostate cancer essentially depends on androgen receptor signaling axis, even in castration-resistant setting, and hence may be targeted by second generation hormonal therapy. However, a subset of patients bears androgen-independent cancer biology with a short-term response to hormonal treatment, early and extensive visceral metastases, low PSA levels and poor outcomes. Identification and specific management of these rapidly fatal malignancies is of an unmet medical need since their classification and utilized therapeutic regimens vary significantly. Unfortunately, molecular pathways have not been sufficiently elucidated yet in order to provide an effective targeted treatment with a prolonged response. Lack of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for these cancers makes successful counteractions against them even more sophisticated. In this comprehensive review, we aimed at summarizing the current body of literature reporting on causal molecular machinery as well as diagnostic and therapeutic concepts of aggressive prostate tumors and draw clinically relevant conclusions for the up-to-date sensible disease management.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\30875581.txt,1,"Recently, adoption of novel drugs for systemic treatment of metastatic prostate cancer has led to a striking improvement of response rate and survival in both hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant disease.

36930079,IKZF3 is a novel prognostic biomarker for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A study based on bioinformatics analysis.,"In the past few years, immunotherapy of tumors has become an extensive research hotspot, and the value of IKZF family genes in the tumor microenvironment has also been increasingly recognized. However, the expression of the IKAROS family zinc finger 3 (IKZF3) gene in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and its prognostic value were not reported for the main subset until now. In the present study, we analyzed the relationship between IKZF3 gene expression and the survival of HNSCC patients. To evaluate the potential of IKZF3 as a prognostic biomarker for HNSCC comprehensively, multiple online analysis tools, including UALCAN, cBioPortal, GEPIA, WebGestalt, String, Genomic Data Commons, and TIMER databases were utilized in our study. We observed that the HNSCC patients with higher IKZF3 expression tended to exhibit longer overall survival. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that age and grade were independent prognostic indicators in HNSCC. Moreover, Gene Ontology and KEGG function enrichment analyses showed that several pathways in HNSCC might be pivotal pathways regulated by IKZF3, which revealed that IKZF3 was probably participating in the occurrence and development of HNSCC. Furthermore, the hypomethylation of the IKZF3 gene was closely associated with genes that observed mutation in HNSCC. IKZF3 was significantly correlated with several immune cells in HNSCC (e.g., CD8+ T cell, CD4+ cell, and dendritic cell). We explored the potential prognostic values and roles of the IKZF3 in HNSCC, revealing that IKZF3 was probably a novel and reliable prognostic biomarker for patients with HNSCC.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\36930079.txt,1,"In the past few years, immunotherapy of tumors has become an extensive research hotspot, and the value of IKZF family genes in the tumor microenvironment has also been increasingly recognized.

36738229,Molecular disparity of HLA-DPB1 is associated with the development of subsequent solid cancer after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"An increased incidence of subsequent solid cancers (SSCs) has been reported in long-term survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), and SSC is associated with inferior mortality and morbidity. Previous studies showed that the incidence of SSC is significantly higher in those who underwent allo-HSCT from HLA-mismatched donors, suggesting that persistent alloimmunity may predispose patients to SSCs. It was recently reported that, in a cohort of patients who received allo-HSCT from an unrelated donor matched at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1/3/4/5, and -DQB1 loci, HLA-DPB1 alloimmunity determined by high mismatched eplets (MEs) and Predicted Indirectly Recognizable HLA Epitopes (PIRCHE) score (PS), was associated with relapse protection and increased risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
In the present study, the impact of HLA-DPB1 alloimmunity assessed by molecular mismatch algorithms on the development of SSCs in a cohort of 1514 patients who underwent allo-HSCT for hematologic malignancies was further investigated. ME load at the HLA-DPB1 locus was measured using the HLAMatchmaker module incorporated in HLA Fusion software, and the PS for mismatched HLA-DPB1 was calculated using the HSCT module from the PIRCHE online matching service.
In multivariable analysis after adjusting for baseline risk factors, higher ME, PS-I, and PS-II in the GVH direction, but not in the HVG direction, were associated with an increased risk of SSCs (ME: subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 1.58, p = .01; PS-I: SHR 1.59, p = .009; PS-II: SHR 1.71, p = .003). In contrast, nonpermissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches defined by the conventional T-cell epitope algorithm were not predictive of the risk of SSCs. Moreover, posttransplant cyclophosphamide-based GVHD prophylaxis was associated with a reduced risk of subsequent solid cancer (SHR 0.34, p = .021).

31209635,Recent advances in invasive adenocarcinoma of the cervix.,"Endocervical adenocarcinomas (ECAs) are currently classified according to the 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) system, which is predominantly based on descriptive morphologic characteristics, considers factors bearing minimal etiological, clinical, or therapeutic relevance, and lacks sufficient reproducibility. The 2017 International Endocervical Adenocarcinoma Criteria and Classification (IECC) system was developed by a group of international collaborators to address these limitations. The IECC system separates ECAs into two major groups-those that are human papillomavirus-associated (HPVA) and those that are non-HPV-associated (NHPVA)-based on morphology (linked to etiology) alone, precluding the need for an expensive panel of immunohistochemical markers for most cases. The major types of HPVA ECA include the usual (with villoglandular and micropapillary architectural variants) and mucinous types (not otherwise specified [NOS], intestinal, signet-ring, and invasive stratified mucin-producing carcinoma). Invasive adenocarcinoma NOS is morphologically uninformative, yet considered part of this group when HPV positive. NHPVA ECAs include gastric, clear cell, endometrioid, and mesonephric types. The IECC system is supported by demographic and clinical features (HPVA ECAs develop in younger patients, are smaller, and are diagnosed at an earlier stage), p16/HPV status (almost all HPVA ECAs are p16 and/or HPV positive), prognostic parameters (NHPVA ECAs more often have lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastases, and are Silva pattern C), and survival data (NHPVA ECAs are associated with worse survival).

27241812,Angiopoietin-2 mediates thrombin-induced monocyte adhesion and endothelial permeability.,"UNLABELLED: Essentials Mechanism of thrombin-induced inflammation is not fully understood. Thrombin induced monocyte adhesion and barrier loss require Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). Ang-2 mediates vessel leakage and monocyte adhesion through SHP-2/p38MAPK pathway. Calcium dependent SHP2/p38MAPK activation regulates Ang-2 expression through a feedback loop. SUMMARY: Background Thrombin imparts an inflammatory phenotype to the endothelium by promoting increased monocyte adhesion and vascular permeability. However, the molecular players that govern these events are incompletely understood. Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) has a role, if any, in regulating inflammatory signals initiated by thrombin. Methods Assessment of vascular leakage by Miles assay was performed by intra-dermal injection on the foot paw. Surface levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were determined by flow cytometry. Overexpression, knockdown and phosphorylation of proteins were determined by Western blotting. Results In time-course experiments, thrombin-stimulated Ang-2 up-regulation, peaked prior to the expression of adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells (HUVECs). Knockdown of Ang-2 blocked both thrombin-induced monocyte adhesion and ICAM-1 expression. In addition, Ang-2(-/-) mice displayed defective vascular leakage when treated with thrombin. Introducing Ang-2 protein in Ang-2(-/-) mice failed to recover a wild-type phenotype. Mechanistically, Ang-2 appears to regulate the thrombin-activated calcium spike that is required for tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and p38 MAPK activation. Further, down-regulation of SHP2 attenuated both thrombin-induced Ang-2 expression and monocyte adhesion. Down-regulation of the adaptor protein Gab1, a co-activator of SHP2, as well as overexpression of the Gab1 mutant incapable of interacting with SHP2 (YFGab1), inhibited thrombin-mediated effects, including downstream activation of p38 MAPK, which in turn was required for Ang-2 expression.

We aimed to delineate the histological characteristics of these tumours and further mutational aspects with a particular focus on sialadenoma papilliferum (SP) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrieved 28 papillary-cystic tumours of the minor salivary glands, and performed histological re-evaluation and mutation analyses of several key oncogenes. The histological classifications were as follows: SP (n = 10), SP-like intraductal papillary tumour (SP-IPT) (n = 2), IPMN (n = 9), intraductal papilloma, cystadenoma, and cystadenocarcinoma (two, three and two respectively). Whereas SP typically consisted of a combination of exophytic squamous epithelium and endophytic intraductal papillary infoldings, SP-IPT lacked the exophytic component. SP and SP-IPT frequently harboured BRAF V600E mutations (75.0%), which were identified in both squamous and ductal components. IPMN was characterised by a well-demarcated cystic lesion filled exclusively with a papillary proliferation of mucinous cells and a high rate of AKT1 E17K mutations (88.9%). Intraductal papillomas were unilocular cystic lesions with intraluminal papillary growth of bland columnar cells. In contrast, both cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas showed a multicystic appearance with a papillary configuration. Cystadenocarcinomas invaded the surrounding tissue and were composed of markedly atypical tumour cells.

36610490,Phase I Study: Safety and Efficacy of an Ex Vivo-Expanded Allogeneic Natural Killer Cell (MG4101) with Rituximab for Relapsed/Refractory B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.,"The prognosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remains poor, with an unmet need for novel therapies. MG4101, an ex vivo-expanded allogeneic natural killer (NK) cell, can enhance rituximab antibody-dependent cytotoxicity in relapsed/refractory (r/r) B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of MG4101 plus rituximab for patients with r/r NHL. Patients received escalating doses of i.v. MG4101 plus rituximab every 2 weeks. IL-2 was administered s.c. after MG4101 treatment. Fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide was administered i.v. before rituximab treatment in cycles 1, 3, and 5. A 3+3 design was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and maximum feasible dose. Assessments were performed over a 6-cycle period, with an extended maintenance period of up to 8 cycles. Nine patients received 3 different doses of MG4101 and rituximab. MTD could not be determined because of the absence of dose-limiting toxicity. Treatment-related adverse events, mostly grade 1 or 2, occurred in 89% of patients. Only 1 patient experienced grade 1 cytokine release syndrome. MG4101 persisted for at least 7 days in 7 patients. Four patients achieved a partial response and 1 patient attained a complete response, for an overall response rate of 55.6%. Two patients showed prolonged responses and low exhaustion marker levels in T cells.

Our aim was to study the levels of NfL measured by ELISA. Furthermore, interstitial matrix metalloproteinase type 1 (MMP-1) serum levels were measured as a potential new biomarker in ATTRv. Serum NfL and MMP-1 were measured using ELISA assays in 90 participants (29 ATTR-V30M patients, 31 asymptomatic V30M-TTR variant carriers and 30 healthy controls). Median NfL levels among ATTRv amyloidosis patients were significantly higher (116 pg/mL vs 0 pg/mL in both comparison groups). The AUC comparing ATTRv amyloidosis patients and asymptomatic carriers was 0.90 and the NfL concentration of 93.55 pg/mL yielded a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 87%. NfL levels had a significant positive correlation with NIS values among patients. We found a negative significant correlation between eGFR and NfL levels.

29775646,The RNA binding protein Ars2 supports hematopoiesis at multiple levels.,"Recent biochemical characterization of arsenic resistance protein 2 (Ars2) has established it as central in determining the fate of nascent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase II (RNAPII) transcripts. Through interactions with the nuclear 5'-7-methylguanosine cap-binding complex, Ars2 promotes cotranscriptional processing coupled with nuclear export or degradation of several classes of RNAPII transcripts, allowing for gene expression programs that facilitate rapid and sustained proliferation of immortalized cells in culture. However, rapidly dividing cells in culture do not represent the physiological condition of the vast majority of cells in an adult mammal. To examine functions of Ars2 in a physiological setting, we generated inducible Ars2 knockout mice and found that deletion of Ars2 from adult mice resulted in defective hematopoiesis in bone marrow and thymus. Importantly, only some of this defect could be explained by the requirement of Ars2 for rapid proliferation, which we found to be cell-type specific in vivo. Rather, Ars2 was required for survival of developing thymocytes and for limiting differentiation of bone marrow resident long-term hematopoietic stem cells. As a result, Ars2 knockout led to rapid thymic involution and loss of the ability of mice to regenerate peripheral blood after myeloablation. These in vivo data demonstrate that Ars2 expression is important at several steps of hematopoiesis, likely because Ars2 acts on gene expression programs underlying essential cell fate decisions such as the decision to die,proliferate, or differentiate.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\29775646.txt,0,"Recent biochemical characterization of arsenic resistance protein 2 (Ars2) has established it as central in determining the fate of nascent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase II (RNAPII) transcripts.

31025086,Integrated diagnostics of diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial gliomas are the most common neuroepithelial tumors. Their classification is based on the integration of histological and molecular findings according to the classification of tumors of the central nervous system published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016. OBJECTIVES: This review describes the different entities and variants of diffuse gliomas and summarizes the current diagnostic criteria for these tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the 2016 WHO classification and selected other publications, the histomolecular diagnostics of diffuse gliomas is presented and illustrated. RESULTS: Diffuse gliomas are divided into isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant or IDH-wildtype gliomas by detection of mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes. Among the IDH-mutant gliomas, oligodendroglial tumors are characterized by combined losses of chromosome arms 1p and 19q. Loss of nuclear expression of the ATRX protein is a marker of IDH- mutant astrocytic gliomas. Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, is the most common diffuse glioma. Diffuse and anaplastic astrocytic gliomas without IDH mutation should be further evaluated for molecular features of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. Diffuse gliomas in the thalamus, brainstem, or spinal cord carrying a histone 3 (H3)-K27M mutation are classified as diffuse midline gliomas, H3-K27M-mutant. By determining the IDH and 1p/19q status, oligoastrocytomas can be stratified into either astrocytic or oligodendroglial gliomas. Gliomatosis cerebri is no longer regarded as a distinct glioma entity.

To investigate which molecular features of MHC-I these quality control mechanisms detect, we have followed the hypothesis that suboptimally loaded MHC-I molecules are characterized by their conformational mobility in the F-pocket region of the peptide-binding site. We have created a novel variant of an MHC-I protein, K(b)-Y84C, in which two alpha-helices in this region are linked by a disulfide bond that mimics the conformational and dynamic effects of bound high-affinity peptide. K(b)-Y84C shows a remarkable increase in the binding affinity to its light chain, beta-2 microglobulin (beta2m), and bypasses all three cellular quality control steps. Our data demonstrate (1) that coupling between peptide and beta2m binding to the MHC-I heavy chain is mediated by conformational dynamics; (2) that the folded conformation of MHC-I, supported by beta2m, plays a decisive role in passing the ER-to-cell-surface transport quality controls; and (3) that beta2m association is also tested by the cell surface quality control that leads to MHC-I endocytosis.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\24806963.txt,0,"The intracellular trafficking of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) proteins is directed by three quality control mechanisms that test for their structural integrity, which is correlated to the binding of high-affinity antigenic peptide ligands.

30884806,Telomeres and Telomerase in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"The role of telomere biology and telomerase activation in skin cancers has been investigated in melanoma and basal cell carcinoma but limited evidence is available for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). We will review the current knowledge on the role of telomere and telomerase pathway in cSCC pathogenesis. At the somatic level, both long and short telomere lengths have been described in cSCC. This telomere dichotomy is probably related to two different mechanisms of tumour initiation which determines two tumour subtypes. Telomere shortening is observed during the invasive progression from in situ forms of cSCC, such as Bowen's disease (BD) and actinic keratosis (AK), to invasive cSCC. At the germline level, controversial results have been reported on the association between constitutive telomere length and risk of cSCC. Approximately 75-85% of cSCC tumours are characterized by a high level of telomerase activity. Telomerase activation has been also reported in AKs and BD and in sun-damaged skin, thus supporting the hypothesis that UV modulates telomerase activity in the skin. Activating TERT promoter mutations have been identified in 32-70% of cSCCs, with the majority showing the UV-signature. No significant correlation was observed between TERT promoter mutations and cSCC clinico-pathological features.

31623866,The role of exosomes and MYC in therapy resistance of acute myeloid leukemia: Challenges and opportunities.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by abnormal production of white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets. The leukemia cells communicate with their microenvironment through nano-vesicle exosomes that are 30-100 nm in diameter. These nano-vesicles are released from body fluids upon fusion of an endocytic compartment with the cell membrane. Exosomes function as cargo to deliver signaling molecules to distant cells. This allows cross-talk between hematopoietic cells and other distant target cell environments. Exosomes support leukemia growth by acting as messengers between tumor cells and the microenvironment as well as inducing oncogenic factors such as c-Myc. Exosomes have also been used as biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis of leukemia. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are two crucial signaling molecules involved in the AML pathogenesis and MYC stability. GSK-3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that coordinates with over 40 different proteins during physiological/pathological conditions in blood cells. The dysregulation in GSK-3 has been reported during hematological malignancies. GSK-3 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting c-MYC, MCL-1 and beta-catenin. Conversely, GSK-3 can also act as tumor promoter in some instances. The pharmacological modulators of GSK-3 such as ABT-869, 6-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO), GS-87 and LY2090314 have shown promise in the treatment of hematological malignancy. PP2A is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of hematological malignancy. PP2A-activating drugs (PADs) can effectively antagonize leukemogenesis.

30922401,Mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma: clinical pathology and treatment options.,"Mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is a distinct subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC) characterized by the presence of abundant extracellular mucin which accounts for at least 50% of the tumor volume. Mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is found in 10%-20% of CRC patients and occurs more commonly in female and younger patients. Moreover, mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is more frequently located in the proximal colon and diagnosed at an advanced stage. Based on its molecular context, mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is associated with the overexpression of mucin 2 (MUC2) and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) proteins. At the same time, it shows higher mutation rates in the fundamental genes of the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma also shows higher rates of microsatellite instability (MSI) than non-mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma which might correlate it with Lynch syndrome and the CpG island methylator phenotype. The prognosis of mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma as to non-mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is debatable. Further, the impaired responses of mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma to palliative or adjuvant chemotherapy warrant more studies to be performed for a specialized treatment for these patients.

30992265,Recommendations for the management of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in adults.,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome induced by aberrantly activated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. The primary (genetic) form, caused by mutations affecting lymphocyte cytotoxicity and immune regulation, is most common in children, whereas the secondary (acquired) form is most frequent in adults. Secondary HLH is commonly triggered by infections or malignancies but may also be induced by autoinflammatory/autoimmune disorders, in which case it is called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS; or MAS-HLH). Most information on the diagnosis and treatment of HLH comes from the pediatric literature. Although helpful in some adult cases, this raises several challenges. For example, the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria developed for children are commonly applied but are not validated for adults. Another challenge in HLH diagnosis is that patients may present with a phenotype indistinguishable from sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Treatment algorithms targeting hyperinflammation are frequently based on pediatric protocols, such as HLH-94 and HLH-2004, which may result in overtreatment and unnecessary toxicity in adults. Therefore, dose reductions, individualized tailoring of treatment duration, and an age-dependent modified diagnostic approach are to be considered.

25578100,Risk factors for anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Symptoms resulting from the activation and release of mediators from the mast cells are observed in about 30% of the patients with mastocytosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anaphylactic reactions and to identify the risk factors for anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis depending on the type of the disease. Furthermore, we analyzed a response to treatment of mediator-related symptoms in this patient group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group included 152 adult patients with mastocytosis. The diagnostic workup included a histopathological examination, flow cytometry, KIT mutation analysis, and measurement of tryptase levels. The diagnosis of allergy was confirmed by the skin prick test and serum immunoglobulin E levels. RESULTS: The prevalence of anaphylactic reactions in the study group was 50% and was higher in patients with systemic mastocytosis (P = 0.007), specifically in its indolent variant (P = 0.026), than in patients with cutaneous mastocytosis. The most frequent triggers of anaphylaxis were food (29%), insect stings (22%), and drugs (15%). Tryptase levels were higher in patients with a history of anaphylaxis (P = 0.029) as well as in those with symptoms provoked by physical factors (P = 0.002). Such symptoms were reported in 112 patients (74%) and were more common in patients with systemic mastocytosis compared with those with cutaneous mastocytosis (P = 0.026). The treatment was ineffective in 8 patients (10.5%) and resulted only in partial remission in 14 patients (18.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The study showed a significant incidence of symptoms related to physical factors in patients with mastocytosis and anaphylaxis in history.

In contrast, the characteristics of patients with BRAFnon-V600E MTs were a left-sided primary tumor location and well-differentiated histology. BRAFnon-V600E MTs were relatively rare and showed different characteristics compared to the BRAFV600E MT. These results may contribute to future precision medicine.","['colorectal cancer', 'tumor', 'cancer', 'sarcoma']",1
29728376,Reconciling newborn screening and a novel splice variant in BTD associated with partial biotinidase deficiency: a BabySeq Project case report.,"Here, we report a newborn female infant from the well-baby cohort of the BabySeq Project who was identified with compound heterozygous BTD gene variants. The two identified variants included a well-established pathogenic variant (c.1612C>T, p.Arg538Cys) that causes profound biotinidase deficiency (BTD) in homozygosity. In addition, a novel splice variant (c.44+1G>A, p.?) was identified in the invariant splice donor region of intron 1, potentially predictive of loss of function. The novel variant was predicted to impact splicing of exon 1; however, given the absence of any reported pathogenic variants in exon 1 and the presence of alternative splicing with exon 1 absent in most tissues in the GTEx database, we assigned an initial classification of uncertain significance. Follow-up medical record review of state-mandated newborn screen (NBS) results revealed an initial out-of-range biotinidase activity level. Levels from a repeat NBS sample barely passed cutoff into the normal range. To determine whether the infant was biotinidase-deficient, subsequent diagnostic enzyme activity testing was performed, confirming partial BTD, and resulted in a change of management for this patient. This led to reclassification of the novel splice variant based on these results. In conclusion, combining the genetic and NBS results together prompted clinical follow-up that confirmed partial BTD and informed this novel splice site's reclassification, emphasizing the importance of combining iterative genetic and phenotypic evaluations.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\29728376.txt,0,"Here, we report a newborn female infant from the well-baby cohort of the BabySeq Project who was identified with compound heterozygous BTD gene variants.

36623684,Identification of Novel Genetic Risk Factors for Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis in Children: Results From the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) Cohort.,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a major cause of pediatric nephrotic syndrome, and African Americans exhibit an increased risk for developing FSGS compared with other populations. Predisposing genetic factors have previously been described in adults. Here we performed genomic screening of primary FSGS in a pediatric African American population.
Prospective cohort with case-control genetic association study design.
140 African American children with chronic kidney disease from the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) cohort, including 32 cases with FSGS.
Over 680,000 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association. We also ran a pathway enrichment analysis and a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-focused association study.
Primary biopsy-proven pediatric FSGS.
Multivariate logistic regression models.
The genome-wide association study revealed 169 SNPs from 14 independent loci significantly associated with FSGS (false discovery rate [FDR]<5%). We observed notable signals for genetic variants within the APOL1 (P=8.6×10<sup>-7</sup>; OR, 25.8 [95% CI, 7.1-94.0]), ALMS1 (P=1.3×10<sup>-7</sup>; 13.0% in FSGS cases vs 0% in controls), and FGFR4 (P=4.3×10<sup>-6</sup>; OR, 24.8 [95% CI, 6.3-97.7]) genes, all of which had previously been associated with adult FSGS, kidney function, or chronic kidney disease. We also highlighted novel, functionally relevant genes, including GRB2 (which encodes a slit diaphragm protein promoting podocyte structure through actin polymerization) and ITGB1 (which is linked to renal injuries). Our results suggest a major role for immune responses and antigen presentation in pediatric FSGS through (1) associations with SNPs in PTPRJ (or CD148, P=3.5×10<sup>-7</sup>), which plays a role in T-cell receptor signaling, (2) HLA-DRB1∗11:01 association (P=6.1×10<sup>-3</sup>; OR, 4.5 [95% CI, 1.5-13.0]), and (3) signaling pathway enrichment (P=1.3×10<sup>-6</sup>).

Our genetic study has identified functionally relevant risk factors and the importance of immune regulation for pediatric primary FSGS, which contributes to a better description of its molecular pathophysiological mechanisms.
We assessed the genetic risk factors for primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) by simultaneously testing over 680,000 genetic markers spread across the genome in 140 children, including 32 with FSGS lesions.

25936905,Evaluation of Posterior Hippocampal Epileptogenicity During Epilepsy Surgery For Temporal Lobe Cavernoma by the Occipital Approach.,"BACKGROUND: Cavernomas frequently are associated with intractable epilepsy. When cavernomas located in the temporal lobe are associated with intractable epilepsy, the hippocampus also may have an epileptic focus. The objective in the present study was to clarify the importance of evaluation of the posterior hippocampal epileptogenicity during epilepsy surgery for posteromedial temporal lobe cavernoma. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: In this study, we describe 2 rare cases of medically intractable epilepsy in patients with posteromedial temporal lobe cavernomas who underwent surgery via the occipital approach. Using longitudinal insertion of depth electrodes into the hippocampus, we evaluated epileptogenicity in both patients from the cavernoma cavity and its surrounding hemosiderin, as well as from the posterior hippocampus near the cavernoma. We show that the transoccipital approach to the posteromedial temporal lobe is compatible with depth electrode insertion and subdural electrode placement on the temporal lobe, enabling an accurate evaluation of potential epileptogenic zones in the posterior part of the hippocampus. Both patients did not experience any seizures and had no postoperative neurologic deficits, and their cognitive functions were intact. CONCLUSIONS: The transoccipital approach enables the optimization of the extent of posterior hippocampectomy while avoiding unnecessary resection for seizure control. We suggest resecting the posterior part of the hippocampus in addition to the cavernoma and surrounding areas in patients with medically refractory epilepsy due to a posteromedial temporal cavernoma.

27815897,Synchronization and Desynchronization of Cells by Interventions on the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint.,"Cell cycle checkpoints are surveillance mechanisms that sequentially and continuously monitor cell cycle progression thereby contributing to the preservation of genetic stability. Among them, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents the occurrence of abnormal divisions by halting the metaphase to anaphase transition following the detection of erroneous microtubules-kinetochore attachment(s). Most synchronization strategies are based on the activation of cell cycle checkpoints to enrich the population of cells in a specific phase of the cell cycle. Here, we develop a two-step protocol of sequential cell synchronization and desynchronization employing antimitotic SAC-inducing agents (i.e., nocodazole or paclitaxel) in combination with the depletion of the SAC kinase MPS1. We describe cytofluorometric and time-lapse videomicroscopy methods to detect cell cycle progression, including the assessment of cell cycle distribution, quantification of mitotic cell fraction, and analysis of single cell fate profile of living cells. We applied these methods to validate the synchronization-desynchronization protocol and to qualitatively and quantitatively determine the impact of SAC inactivation on the activity of antimitotic agents.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\27815897.txt,0,"Cell cycle checkpoints are surveillance mechanisms that sequentially and continuously monitor cell cycle progression thereby contributing to the preservation of genetic stability.

In addition to cutaneous and ophthalmological features, some patients present with XP neurological disease. It is unknown whether the different neurological signs and their progression differ among groups. Therefore, we aim to characterize the XP neurological disease and its evolution in the heterogeneous UK XP cohort. Patients with XP were followed in the UK National XP Service, from 2009 to 2021. Age of onset for different events was recorded. Cerebellar ataxia and additional neurological signs and symptoms were rated with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS) and the Activities of Daily Living questionnaire (ADL). Patients' mutations received scores based on their predicted effects. Data from available ancillary tests were collected. Ninety-three XP patients were recruited. Thirty-six (38.7%) reported neurological symptoms, especially in the XPA, XPD and XPG groups, with early-onset and late-onset forms, and typically appearing after cutaneous and ophthalmological symptoms. XPA, XPD and XPG patients showed higher SARA scores compared to XPC, XPE and XPV. SARA total scores significantly increased over time in XPD (0.91 points/year, 95% confidence interval: 0.61, 1.21) and XPA (0.63 points/year, 95% confidence interval: 0.38, 0.89). Hyporeflexia, hypopallesthaesia, upper motor neuron signs, chorea, dystonia, oculomotor signs and cognitive impairment were frequent findings in XPA, XPD and XPG. Cerebellar and global brain atrophy, axonal sensory and sensorimotor neuropathies, and sensorineural hearing loss were common findings in patients. Some XPC, XPE and XPV cases presented with abnormalities on examination and/or ancillary tests, suggesting underlying neurological involvement. More severe mutations were associated with a faster progression in SARA total score in XPA (0.40 points/year per 1-unit increase in severity score) and XPD (0.60 points/year per 1-unit increase), and in ADL total score in XPA (0.35 points/year per 1-unit increase).

As this tumor exhibits epithelioid morphology, it frequently causes diagnostic confusion with other epithelioid vascular neoplasms as well as carcinoma. While 90% of classic EHE are driven by a WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion gene, a histologically distinctive subset of EHE has been recently shown to harbor a different fusion gene, YAP1-TFE3. This variant is likely underrecognized given its rarity and only recent description. Notably, EHE frequently involves the liver but only one case of hepatic YAP1-TFE3 rearranged EHE has been reported to date. We present the second case of YAP1-TFE3 rearranged EHE affecting a 65-year-old woman and presenting as multiple liver masses, with characterization of the fusion gene at the transcriptomic and genomic levels. There are several educational points noted from this case. YAP1-TFE3 rearranged EHE shows distinctly vasoformative foci, unlike classic EHE and mimicking angiosarcoma or epithelioid hemangioma.

38324982,Targeted macrophage phagocytosis by Irg1/itaconate axis improves the prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke and peritonitis.,"Macrophages are innate immune cells whose phagocytosis function is critical to the prognosis of stroke and peritonitis. cis-aconitic decarboxylase immune-responsive gene 1 (Irg1) and its metabolic product itaconate inhibit bacterial infection, intracellular viral replication, and inflammation in macrophages. Here we explore whether itaconate regulates phagocytosis.
Phagocytosis of macrophages was investigated by time-lapse video recording, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining in macrophage/microglia cultures isolated from mouse tissue. Unbiased RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing assays were used to explore the underlying mechanisms. The effects of Irg1/itaconate axis on the prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (ICH) and peritonitis was observed in transgenic (Irg1<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Cx3cr1<sup>creERT/+</sup>, cKO) mice or control mice in vivo.
In a mouse model of ICH, depletion of Irg1 in macrophage/microglia decreased its phagocytosis of erythrocytes, thereby exacerbating outcomes (n = 10 animals/group, p < 0.05). Administration of sodium itaconate/4-octyl itaconate (4-OI) promoted macrophage phagocytosis (n = 7 animals/group, p < 0.05).

Phagocytosis of macrophages was investigated by time-lapse video recording, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining in macrophagemicroglia cultures isolated from mouse tissue. Unbiased RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing assays were used to explore the underlying mechanisms. The effects of Irg1itaconate axis on the prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (ICH) and peritonitis was observed in transgenic (Irg1floxflox; Cx3cr1creERT, cKO) mice or control mice in vivo. In a mouse model of ICH, depletion of Irg1 in macrophagemicroglia decreased its phagocytosis of erythrocytes, thereby exacerbating outcomes (n  10 animalsgroup, p  0.05).

Thirty-four FAP patients older than 18 years, bearing the APC pathogenic variant, who underwent prophylactic total colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis were eligible into the study. During the 3-month dietary intervention, they reported improvements in their consumption of Mediterranean foods (vegetables, fruits, fish, and legumes), and a reduction in pro-inflammatory foods (red/processed meat and sweets); this led to a significant increase in their adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The improvement was accompanied by a decrease in the number of diarrhoeal discharges.

However, the role and mechanism of macrophage STING signaling in modulating tumor microenvironment to suppress tumor growth at secondary sites remains largely unclear.
STING expression was assessed in liver samples from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastasis. Global or myeloid stimulator of interferon gene (STING)-deficient mice, myeloid NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-deficient mice, and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to a mouse model of CRC liver metastasis by intrasplenic injection of murine colon carcinoma cells (MC38). Liver non-parenchymal cells including macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells were isolated for flow cytometry analysis. Bone marrow-derived macrophages pretreated with MC38 were co-cultured with splenic NK cells for in vitro studies.
Significant activation of STING signaling were detected in adjacent and tumor tissues and intrahepatic macrophages. Global or myeloid STING-deficient mice had exacerbated CRC liver metastasis and shorten survival, with decreased intrahepatic infiltration and impaired antitumor function of NK cells. Depletion of NK cells in WT animals increased their metastatic burden, while no significant effects were observed in myeloid STING-deficient mice. STING activation contributed to the secretion of interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1β by macrophages, which optimized antitumor activity of NK cells by promoting the expression of 4-1BBL in macrophages and 4-1BB in NK cells, respectively. Moreover, MC38 treatment activated macrophage NLRP3 signaling, which was inhibited by STING depletion. Myeloid NLRP3 deficiency increased tumor burden and suppressed activation of NK cells. NLRP3 activation by its agonist effectively suppressed CRC liver metastasis in myeloid SITNG-deficient mice.

We demonstrate a strong increase in the number of CD8+HLADR+ T cells with age in a cohort of female Sardinians as well as in elderly male and female persons from Austria.

Intralaminar screwing of the thoracic spine has been described in few cases in which pedicles were hypoplasic. The costovertebral joints have never been used before as an anchorage point for screws. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to describe a new thoracic fixation technique to be used in severe deformities whenever the posterior arch (laminae and pedicles) is not available because of anatomic abnormalities. STUDY DESIGN: This is a case report. METHODS: An 18-year-old woman with progressive tetraparesis caused by increasing deformity of cervicothoracic spine underwent evaluation and surgical treatment: procedure and techniques were described. The clinical features, the radiological findings, and the outcomes were assessed. Complications and local recurrences were also recorded. RESULTS: Costotransverse joint screwing was successfully used in one case of severe cervicothoracic spine deformity with major hypoplasia of the pedicles. The posterior arch of one thoracic vertebra became mobile soon after periosteal stripping probably because of iatrogenic fracture of the only existent pedicle. The four-cortical trajectory of the screws resulted in a good bone purchase allowing the surgeon to complete the procedure. No local or general complications were recorded during 2 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure was used as a salvage technique during a difficult surgery where a local complication forced a change of strategy. Although the implant remained stable long enough to achieve fusion, it still consists of placing a screw through a joint that remains slightly mobile. This could possibly result in a screw loosening in the long period if fusion is not achieved.

We suggest the use of this technique when all the other options have been explored and excluded for anatomical reasons.",[],0
31050834,Six1 regulates leukemia stem cell maintenance in acute myeloid leukemia.,"Molecular genetic changes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) play crucial roles in leukemogenesis, including recurrent chromosome translocations, epigenetic/spliceosome mutations and transcription factor aberrations. Six1, a transcription factor of the Sine oculis homeobox (Six) family, has been shown to transform normal hematopoietic progenitors into leukemia in cooperation with Eya. However, the specific role and the underlying mechanism of Six1 in leukemia maintenance remain unexplored. Here, we showed increased expression of SIX1 in AML patients and murine leukemia stem cells (c-Kit+ cells, LSCs). Importantly, we also observed that a higher level of Six1 in human patients predicts a worse prognosis. Notably, knockdown of Six1 significantly prolonged the survival of MLL-AF9-induced AML mice with reduced peripheral infiltration and tumor burden. AML cells from Six1-knockdown (KD) mice displayed a significantly decreased number and function of LSC, as assessed by the immunophenotype, colony-forming ability and limiting dilution assay. Further analysis revealed the augmented apoptosis of LSC and decreased expression of glycolytic genes in Six1 KD mice. Overall, our data showed that Six1 is essential for the progression of MLL-AF9-induced AML via maintaining the pool of LSC.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31050834.txt,1,"Molecular genetic changes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) play crucial roles in leukemogenesis, including recurrent chromosome translocations, epigeneticspliceosome mutations and transcription factor aberrations.

28429859,Aneurysms in neurofibromatosis type 2: Evidence for vasculopathy?,"There have been anecdotal reports of vasculopathy associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). Given the increasing use of bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor which results in an increased risk of bleeding, it is important to ascertain if there is a predisposition to vascular abnormalities in NF2. In our unit NF2 patients undergo annual MRI brain and internal auditory meatus imaging. We noted incidental intracranial aneurysms in some patients and sought to determine the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in our cohort of NF2 patients. We conducted a retrospective audit of the MRI images of 104 NF2 patients from 2014 to 2016. Axial T2 brain MRI images were assessed for vascular abnormalities by two neuroradiologists blinded to patient's clinical details. Intracranial aneurysms were detected in four patients and an aneurysm clip related to previous surgery was noted in one additional patient. Using standard MRI imaging sequences alone we provide evidence of intracranial aneurysms in 4.4% of our cohort. This compares with an estimated overall prevalence of 3% in the general population.

METHODS: To assess the prognostic value of ACLY transcript, we conducted a study with a discovery and validation design. We measured ACLY transcript by real-time quantitative PCR in 274 AML patients, and validated the prognostic value in the two independent cohorts using published data. Meta-analysis of gene-expression profile and inhibition ACLY expression in leukemia cell lines were conducted to help us understand the biological insight of low ACLY expression. RESULTS: Low ACLY expression is less common amongst AMLs with DNMT3A mutations, but coexisted in double allele CEBPA mutations. Moreover, low ACLY expression is associated with favorable overall survival in AML patients and is involved in multiple pathways.

Nevertheless, many efforts have been made by clinicians to identify specific clinical features which might help in differentiating one disorder from another. Here, we describe a child initially diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome. The follow-up of the proband, the clinical evaluation of his father together with a gene-by-gene testing approach led us to the proper diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 8-year-old male with multiple cafe-au-lait macules, several lentigines and dysmorphic features that suggest Noonan syndrome initially diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome. However, after a few years of clinical and ophthalmological follow-up, the absence of typical features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 and the lack of NF1 mutation led us to reconsider the original diagnosis. A new examination of the patient and his similarly affected father, who was initially referred as healthy, led us to suspect LEOPARD syndrome, The diagnosis was then confirmed by the occurrence in both patients of a heterozygous mutation c.1403 C > T, p.(Thr468Met), of PTPN11.

This study includes 31 distinct heterozygous variants in KMT2E (28 ascertained from Matchmaker Exchange and three previously reported), and four individuals with chromosome 7q22.2-22.23 microdeletions encompassing KMT2E (one previously reported). Almost all variants occurred de novo, and most were truncating. Most affected individuals with protein-truncating variants presented with mild intellectual disability. One-quarter of individuals met criteria for autism. Additional common features include macrocephaly, hypotonia, functional gastrointestinal abnormalities, and a subtle facial gestalt. Epilepsy was present in about one-fifth of individuals with truncating variants and was responsive to treatment with anti-epileptic medications in almost all. More than 70% of the individuals were male, and expressivity was variable by sex; epilepsy was more common in females and autism more common in males. The four individuals with microdeletions encompassing KMT2E generally presented similarly to those with truncating variants, but the degree of developmental delay was greater.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of screw misplacement and related complications in patients who underwent fluoroscopy-guided transpedicular screw fixation at a neurosurgical teaching institution. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who underwent fluoroscopy-guided transpedicular screw fixation from January 2007 to May 2011 in the Department of Neurosurgery, Kantonsspital Aarau, a certified Swiss National Neurosurgical Education and Training Center. The accuracy of the pedicle screw trajectory was assessed using reconstructed postoperative axial, sagittal, and coronal computed tomography images. The displacement was classified as minor (<= 2 mm), moderate (2.1-4 mm), and severe (>4 mm). RESULTS: A total of 1236 pedicle screws were placed in 273 consecutive patients in the thoracic and lumbosacral spine. All surgeries were performed under the supervision of 7 board-certified neurosurgeons and faculty members. A total of 17 surgeons, including trainees, participated in all procedures.

We present a rare case of a giant and single acrochordon on the lumbar region with signs of ischemia. The correlation of clinical, dermatoscopic, and histopathological analyses may help the clinician differentiate this entity from other benign and malignant dermatoses. A 33-year-old man presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of a lumbar mass that had been growing for two years. The lesion was asymptomatic except for recent discomfort when lying in the supine decubitus position. On examination there was a single, erythematous, non-tender pedunculated lesion, 5.1 cm x 4 cm x 3.2 cm in size, with flaccid bullae on its surface and firm consistency (Figure 1, a-b). Dermoscopy showed regularly arranged dotted vessels in a violaceous background and bullae filled with serous fluid (Figure 1, c-d). His personal and family medical history were unremarkable. Shave excision was performed and the sample was sent for histopathologic analysis. Histopathology revealed a normal epidermis surrounding a core of loose collagen fibers. Papillary dermis showed a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, congested capillaries, and extravasated erythrocytes. Scattered clusters of adipocytes were found in the deep dermis (Figure 2). The diagnosis of a giant ischemic acrochordon was established. Acrochordons, also commonly known as skin tags, are benign pedunculated neoplasms frequently found on the neck, axillae, or groin. They represent fibroepithelial polyps that originate from ectoderm and mesoderm tissue (1). They can be pigmented or skin colored and usually range between 2 to 5 mm in size. Skin tags can affect nearly 46% of the general population (2). Giant and solitary acrochordons are an uncommon clinical variant (2). Differential diagnosis of this pathology may be challenging in the particular clinical context of this patient. Benign neoplasms such as dermatofibroma, neurofibroma, and epidermal inclusion cysts can be clinically similar to giant skin tags (1,2). Histopathological analyses of acrochordons usually show papillomatosis, irregular acanthosis, loose collagen fibers, and dilated capillaries (2). A fibrolipomatous variant of acrochordon may reveal adipose tissue lobules between septa of collagen on pathological examination (1). Local ischemia due to twisting of the stalk may induce the formation of intradermal or subepidermal blisters in these tumors. Histopathologic characteristics found in ischemic acrochordons are neutrophil infiltration, congested capillaries, and extravasated erythrocytes (3). Fibroepithelioma of Pinkus (FeP) is a rare variant of basal cell carcinoma that may clinically mimic benign polypoid tumors and has a certain predilection for the lumbosacral area. Dermoscopic characteristics of fibroepithelioma of Pinkus that may aid the clinician in this diagnosis are fine arborizing vessels, either alone or associated with dotted vessels, and white streaks (4). Cosmetically adequate treatment of a giant acrochordon can be performed by shave excision and electrodesiccation of its pedicle.

The lesion was asymptomatic except for recent discomfort when lying in the supine decubitus position. On examination there was a single, erythematous, non-tender pedunculated lesion, 5.1 cm x 4 cm x 3.2 cm in size, with flaccid bullae on its surface and firm consistency (Figure 1, a-b). Dermoscopy showed regularly arranged dotted vessels in a violaceous background and bullae filled with serous fluid (Figure 1, c-d). His personal and family medical history were unremarkable. Shave excision was performed and the sample was sent for histopathologic analysis. Histopathology revealed a normal epidermis surrounding a core of loose collagen fibers. Papillary dermis showed a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, congested capillaries, and extravasated erythrocytes. Scattered clusters of adipocytes were found in the deep dermis (Figure 2). The diagnosis of a giant ischemic acrochordon was established. Acrochordons, also commonly known as skin tags, are benign pedunculated neoplasms frequently found on the neck, axillae, or groin. They represent fibroepithelial polyps that originate from ectoderm and mesoderm tissue (1). They can be pigmented or skin colored and usually range between 2 to 5 mm in size. Skin tags can affect nearly 46 of the general population (2). Giant and solitary acrochordons are an uncommon clinical variant (2). Differential diagnosis of this pathology may be challenging in the particular clinical context of this patient. Benign neoplasms such as dermatofibroma, neurofibroma, and epidermal inclusion cysts can be clinically similar to giant skin tags (1,2). Histopathological analyses of acrochordons usually show papillomatosis, irregular acanthosis, loose collagen fibers, and dilated capillaries (2). A fibrolipomatous variant of acrochordon may reveal adipose tissue lobules between septa of collagen on pathological examination (1). Local ischemia due to twisting of the stalk may induce the formation of intradermal or subepidermal blisters in these tumors. Histopathologic characteristics found in ischemic acrochordons are neutrophil infiltration, congested capillaries, and extravasated erythrocytes (3). Fibroepithelioma of Pinkus (FeP) is a rare variant of basal cell carcinoma that may clinically mimic benign polypoid tumors and has a certain predilection for the lumbosacral area. Dermoscopic characteristics of fibroepithelioma of Pinkus that may aid the clinician in this diagnosis are fine arborizing vessels, either alone or associated with dotted vessels, and white streaks (4). Cosmetically adequate treatment of a giant acrochordon can be performed by shave excision and electrodesiccation of its pedicle. Choudhary et al. reported good results with this technique on a giant acrochordon on the thigh (5).",['carcinoma'],1
25623620,Hypogammaglobulinemia in children after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a cytokine mediated immunoglobulin isotype class switch arrest?,"BACKGROUND: Hypogammaglobulinemia (hypo-IgG) is common early post-HSCT in children, occasionally necessitating long-term immunoglobulin (Ig) G replacement therapy. IgG replacement may not reduce mortality, although infectious complications are decreased PROCEDURE: Clinical data and samples from 86 children were analyzed retrospectively with the aim to identify risk factors for developing long-term hypo-IgG (i.e., requiring >= 3 months IgG replacement) post-HSCT and studying the underlying biology. Laboratory studies covered serum cytokines, IGHG2 genotyping and routine laboratory investigations. Results were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent of the children developed long-term hypo-IgG. These children were younger (<5 years) and had higher acute GvHD incidence, but had better overall survival (88% vs. 69%, P = 0.036). Significantly lower Ig levels post-HSCT but equal immune cell recovery were seen in patients with long-term hypo-IgG compared with those of transient or no hypo-IgG. Pre-HSCT IL-6 and -7 and post-HSCT BAFF and APRIL levels were significantly higher in the long-term hypo-IgG group. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggests an unfavorable cytokine milieu for graft-derived immune recovery, possibly inducing Ig isotype class switch arrest. Younger age, acute GvHD, and higher pre-HSCT IL-6 levels were identified as significant risk factors for long-term hypo-IgG.

We aimed to identify the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncogenic variants and characterise the CD34+ cells.
We analysed BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncogenic variant by digital droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction in 53 MTLE-HS samples (25 with CD34+ cells) and nine non-expansive neocortical lesions resected during epilepsy surgery (five with CD34+ cells).

We identified a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncogenic variant in five MTLE-HS samples with CD34+ cells (19%) and in five neocortical samples with CD34+ cells (100%). Single nuclei RNAseq of resected samples revealed two unique clusters of abnormal cells (including CD34+ cells) associated with senescence and oligodendrocyte development in both hippocampal and neocortical BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant samples. The co-expression of the oncogene-induced senescence marker p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and the outer subventricular zone radial glia progenitor marker HOPX in CD34+ cells was confirmed by multiplex immunostaining.

31409085,An Update on Inherited Colon Cancer and Gastrointestinal Polyposis.,"BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 5-10% of colorectal cancers arise due to a known genetic syndrome. Individuals with these cancer syndromes are also at risk of extracolonic cancers. Polyposis and nonpolyposis hereditary syndromes are generally recognized. Inclusion of next-generation sequencing technology, especially multiple-gene panel testing, in routine laboratory practice has made identifying the causes of these diseases significantly easier. PURPOSE: To summarize current knowledge of the causes, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, and recommendations for presymptomatic screening of individuals at risk of hereditary gastrointestinal polyposis and colorectal cancer syndromes. We dicuss currently defined syndromes detected by multiple-gene panel next-generation sequencing; these include constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (biallelic MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 gene mutations), gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (APC gene), NTHL1-associated polyposis, polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis (POLD1, POLE genes), juvenile polyposis (SMAD4, BMPR1A genes), and serrated polyposis syndromes. Another aim is to summarize recent knowledge about well-known syndromes, including hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome), familial adenomatous polyposis, MUTYH-associated polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers and Cowden/PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes.

In this review, we have collated the gene mutations, gene expression, epigenetic regulation and protein expression reported by a number of studies on gynaecological carcinosarcomas. Based on these results, we describe potential therapeutics that may demonstrate efficacy and present any pre-clinical studies that have been carried out.

Here we show by three-dimensional imaging and manipulation of cell morphological states that blebbing triggers the formation of plasma membrane-proximal signalling hubs that confer anoikis resistance. Specifically, in melanoma cells, blebbing generates plasma membrane contours that recruit curvature-sensing septin proteins as scaffolds for constitutively active mutant NRAS and effectors. These signalling hubs activate ERK and PI3K-well-established promoters of pro-survival pathways. Inhibition of blebs or septins has little effect on the survival of well-adhered cells, but in detached cells it causes NRAS mislocalization, reduced MAPK and PI3K activity, and ultimately, death. This unveils a morphological requirement for mutant NRAS to operate as an effective oncoprotein. Furthermore, whereas some BRAF-mutated melanoma cells do not rely on this survival pathway in a basal state, inhibition of BRAF and MEK strongly sensitizes them to both bleb and septin inhibition. Moreover, fibroblasts engineered to sustain blebbing acquire the same anoikis resistance as cancer cells even without harbouring oncogenic mutations.

37148359,The power of TOPMed imputation for the discovery of Latino-enriched rare variants associated with type 2 diabetes.,"The Latino population has been systematically underrepresented in large-scale genetic analyses, and previous studies have relied on the imputation of ungenotyped variants based on the 1000 Genomes (1000G) imputation panel, which results in suboptimal capture of low-frequency or Latino-enriched variants. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) released the largest multi-ancestry genotype reference panel representing a unique opportunity to analyse rare genetic variations in the Latino population. We hypothesise that a more comprehensive analysis of low/rare variation using the TOPMed panel would improve our knowledge of the genetics of type 2 diabetes in the Latino population.
We evaluated the TOPMed imputation performance using genotyping array and whole-exome sequence data in six Latino cohorts. To evaluate the ability of TOPMed imputation to increase the number of identified loci, we performed a Latino type 2 diabetes genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis in 8150 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 10,735 control individuals and replicated the results in six additional cohorts including whole-genome sequence data from the All of Us cohort.
Compared with imputation with 1000G, the TOPMed panel improved the identification of rare and low-frequency variants.

A Latino-tailored polygenic score constructed from our data and GWAS data from East Asian and European populations improved the prediction accuracy in a Latino target dataset, explaining up to 7.6% of the type 2 diabetes risk variance.

Using mouse genetics, we find that altered Nf1 gene-dose in mature oligodendrocytes results in progressive myelin defects and behavioral abnormalities mediated by aberrant Notch activation. Blocking Notch, upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or nitric oxide signaling rescues myelin defects in hemizygous Nf1 mutants, and pharmacological gamma secretase inhibition rescues aberrant behavior with no effects in wild-type (WT) mice. Concomitant pathway inhibition rescues myelin abnormalities in homozygous mutants.

We thus identify Notch as an Nf1 effector regulating myelin structure and behavior in a RASopathy and suggest that inhibition of Notch signaling may be a therapeutic strategy for NF1.",[],0
31065274,A Potential Antitumor Effect of Dendritic Cells Fused with Cancer Stem Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"HCC stem cells were reported as posttreatment residual tumor cells that play a pivotal role in tumor relapse. Fusing dendritic cells (DCs) with tumor cells represents an ideal approach to effectively activate the antitumor immunity in vivo. DC/HCC stem cell vaccine provides a potential strategy to generate polyclonal immune response to multiple tumor stem cell antigens including those yet to be unidentified. To assess the potential capacity of DC/HCC stem cell vaccines against HCC, CD90+HepG2 cells were sorted from the HCC cell line HepG2. DC and CD90+HepG2 and DC and HepG2 fused cells were induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG). The influence of fusion cells on proliferation and immunological function transformation of lymphocytes was assessed by FCM and ELISA assay, respectively. The cytotoxicity assay of specific fusion cell-induced CTLs against HepG2 was conducted by CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit in vitro. At last, the prevention of HCC formation in vivo was described in a mouse model. The results of FCM analysis showed that the proportion of CD90+HepG2 cells in the spheral CD90+HepG2 enriched by suspension sphere culture was ranging from 98.7% to 99.5%, and 57.1% CD90+HepG2/DC fused cells were successfully constructed. The fusion cells expressed a higher level of costimulatory molecules CD80, CD83, CD86, and MHC-I and MHC-II molecules HLA-ABC and HLA-DR than did immature DCs (P < 0.05). And the functional analysis of fusion cell-induced CTLs also illustrated that CD90+HepG2/DC fusion cells showed a greater capacity to activate proliferation of lymphocytes in vitro (P < 0.05). The CD90+HepG2/DC-activated CTLs had a specific killing ability against CD90+HepG2 cells in vivo. These results suggested that CD90+HepG2/DC fusion cells could efficiently stimulate T lymphocytes to generate specific CTLs targeting CD90+HepG2 cells.

24418349,Blood expression profiles of fragile X premutation carriers identify candidate genes involved in neurodegenerative and infertility phenotypes.,"Male premutation carriers presenting between 55 and 200 CGG repeats in the Fragile-X-associated (FMR1) gene are at risk of developing Fragile X Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), and females undergo Premature Ovarian Failure (POF1). Here, we have evaluated gene expression profiles from blood in male FMR1 premutation carriers and detected a strong deregulation of genes enriched in FXTAS relevant biological pathways, including inflammation, neuronal homeostasis and viability. Gene expression profiling distinguished between control individuals, carriers with FXTAS and carriers without FXTAS, with levels of expanded FMR1 mRNA being increased in FXTAS patients. In vitro studies in a neuronal cell model indicate that expression levels of expanded FMR1 5'-UTR are relevant in modulating the transcriptome. Thus, perturbations of the transcriptome may be an interplay between the CGG expansion size and FMR1 expression levels. Several deregulated genes (DFFA, BCL2L11, BCL2L1, APP, SOD1, RNF10, HDAC5, KCNC3, ATXN7, ATXN3 and EAP1) were validated in brain samples of a FXTAS mouse model. Downregulation of EAP1, a gene involved in the female reproductive system physiology, was confirmed in female carriers. Decreased levels were detected in female carriers with POF1 compared to those without POF1, suggesting that EAP1 levels contribute to ovarian insufficiency. In summary, gene expression profiling in blood has uncovered mechanisms that may underlie different pathological aspects of the premutation.

METHODS: This was an observer-blinded cohort study investigating effects of common functional polymorphisms in dopa decarboxylase (DDC, rs921451), monoamine oxidase B (MAOB; rs1799836), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT, rs4680), and dopamine transporter/solute carrier family 6 member 3 (DAT/SLC6A3, variable number tandem repeats) genes on 18 F-fluorodopa uptake and an effective distribution volume ratio (inverse of dopamine turnover) measured by 18 F-fluorodopa PET in 28 untreated PD patients. RESULTS: Patients carrying the MAOBCC/(C)/CT genotype (low/intermediate enzyme activity) had a lower dopamine turnover in the putamen (higher mean effective distribution volume ratio) when compared with patients with MAOBTT/(T) genotype (high enzyme activity). Striatal PET measures were not different between variants in the remaining genes. CONCLUSIONS: The MAOB (rs1799836) polymorphism predicts putaminal dopamine turnover in early PD with the MAOBTT allele linked to high enzyme activity leading to higher intrinsic dopamine turnover, which has been demonstrated to constitute a risk factor for motor complications.   2018 The Authors.

31263451,Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1): An Update and the Significance of Early Genetic and Clinical Diagnosis.,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare hereditary tumor syndrome inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and characterized by a predisposition to a multitude of endocrine neoplasms primarily of parathyroid, enteropancreatic, and anterior pituitary origin, as well as nonendocrine neoplasms. Other endocrine tumors in MEN1 include foregut carcinoid tumors, adrenocortical tumors, and rarely pheochromocytoma. Nonendocrine manifestations include meningiomas and ependymomas, lipomas, angiofibromas, collagenomas, and leiomyomas. MEN1 is caused by inactivating mutations of the tumor suppressor gene MEN1 which encodes the protein menin. This syndrome can affect all age groups, with 17% of patients developing MEN1-associated tumors before 21 years of age. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of MEN1-associated tumors, patients with MEN1 continue to have decreased life expectancy primarily due to malignant neuroendocrine tumors. The most recent clinical practice guidelines for MEN1, published in 2012, highlight the need for early genetic and clinical diagnosis of MEN1 and recommend an intensive surveillance approach for both patients with this syndrome and asymptomatic carriers starting at the age of 5 years with the goal of timely detection and management of MEN1-associated neoplasms and ultimately decreased disease-specific morbidity and mortality.

36542815,"Circulating Tumor DNA Profiling for Detection, Risk Stratification, and Classification of Brain Lymphomas.","Clinical outcomes of patients with CNS lymphomas (CNSLs) are remarkably heterogeneous, yet identification of patients at high risk for treatment failure is challenging. Furthermore, CNSL diagnosis often remains unconfirmed because of contraindications for invasive stereotactic biopsies. Therefore, improved biomarkers are needed to better stratify patients into risk groups, predict treatment response, and noninvasively identify CNSL.
We explored the value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for early outcome prediction, measurable residual disease monitoring, and surgery-free CNSL identification by applying ultrasensitive targeted next-generation sequencing to a total of 306 tumor, plasma, and CSF specimens from 136 patients with brain cancers, including 92 patients with CNSL.
Before therapy, ctDNA was detectable in 78% of plasma and 100% of CSF samples. Patients with positive ctDNA in pretreatment plasma had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS, <i>P</i> < .0001, log-rank test) and overall survival (OS, <i>P</i> = .0001, log-rank test). In multivariate analyses including established clinical and radiographic risk factors, pretreatment plasma ctDNA concentrations were independently prognostic of clinical outcomes (PFS HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.9; <i>P</i> = .03; OS HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.2; <i>P</i> = .006). Moreover, measurable residual disease detection by plasma ctDNA monitoring during treatment identified patients with particularly poor prognosis following curative-intent immunochemotherapy (PFS, <i>P</i> = .0002; OS, <i>P</i> = .004, log-rank test). Finally, we developed a proof-of-principle machine learning approach for biopsy-free CNSL identification from ctDNA, showing sensitivities of 59% (CSF) and 25% (plasma) with high positive predictive value.
We demonstrate robust and ultrasensitive detection of ctDNA at various disease milestones in CNSL. Our findings highlight the role of ctDNA as a noninvasive biomarker and its potential value for personalized risk stratification and treatment guidance in patients with CNSL.

31461190,Adenomatous Polyposis Coli as a Major Regulator of Human Embryonic Stem Cells Self-Renewal.,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) provide an essential tool to investigate early human development, study disease pathogenesis, and examine therapeutic interventions. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, implicated in the majority of sporadic colorectal cancers and in the autosomal dominant inherited syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Studies into the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in hESCs arrived at conflicting results, due at least in part to variations in culture conditions and the use of external inhibitors and agonists. Here, we directly targeted APC in hESCs carrying a germline APC mutation, derived from affected blastocysts following preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for FAP, in order to answer open questions regarding the role of APC in regulating pluripotency and differentiation potential of hESCs. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9), we generated second hit APC mutations in FAP-hESCs. Despite high CRISPR/Cas9 targeting efficiency and the successful isolation of many clones, none of the isolated clones carried a loss of function mutation in the wild-type (WT) APC allele. Using a fluorescent beta-catenin reporter and analysis of mutated-allele frequencies in the APC locus, we show that APC double mutant hESCs robustly activate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that results in rapid differentiation to endodermal and mesodermal lineages. Here, we provide direct evidence for a strict requirement for constant beta-catenin degradation through the APC destruction complex in order to maintain pluripotency, highlighting a fundamental role for APC in self-renewal of hESCs.

Size measurements are inadequate to assess treatment response to these agents, and newer response assessment criteria are needed. We aimed to evaluate F-FDG PET-derived texture parameters in a preclinical colorectal cancer model as alternative metrics of response to treatment with bevacizumab. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen CD1 athymic mice injected in the flank with 5x106 LS174T cells (human colorectal carcinoma) were either untreated controls (n=7) or bevacizumab treated (n=7). After 2 weeks, mice underwent F-FDG PET/CT. Calliper-measured tumor growth (Deltavol) and final tumor volume (Volcal), F-FDG PET metabolically active volume (Volmet), mean metabolism (Metmean), and maximum metabolism (Metmax) were measured. Twenty-four texture features were compared between treated and untreated mice. Immunohistochemical mean tumor vascular density was estimated by anti-CD-34 staining after tumor resection. RESULTS: Treated mice had significantly lower tumor vascular density (P=0.032), confirming the antiangiogenic therapeutic effect of bevacizumab. None of the conventional measures were different between the two groups: Deltavol (P=0.9), Volcal (P=0.7), Volmet (P=0.28), Metmax (P=0.7), or Metmean (P=0.32).

However, some cases lack aggregate formation and fulfill the World Health Organization 2008 criteria for SM, based on minor criteria. METHODS: We identified 26 BM cases of KIT D816V-mutated, morphologically occult SM in the BM. RESULTS: All patients had some combination of allergic/MC activating symptoms. Peripheral blood counts were generally normal. BM aspirates showed 5% or less MCs, which were only occasionally spindled. BM biopsy specimens showed no morphologic classic MC lesions. Tryptase immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated interstitial, individually distributed MCs (up to 5%) with prominent spindling, lacking aggregate formation.

28960434,Utility and limitations of exome sequencing in the molecular diagnosis of pediatric inherited platelet disorders.,"Inherited platelet disorders (IPD) are a heterogeneous group of rare disorders that affect platelet number and function and often predispose to other significant medical complications. In spite of the identification of over 50 IPD disease-associated genes, a molecular diagnosis is only identified in a minority (10%) of affected patients without a clinically suspected etiology. We studied a cohort of 21 pediatric patients with suspected IPDs by exome sequencing (ES) to: (1) examine the performance of the exome test for IPD genes, (2) determine if this exome-wide diagnostic test provided a higher diagnostic yield than has been previously reported, (3) to evaluate the frequency of variants of uncertain significance identified, and (4) to identify candidate variants for functional evaluation in patients with an uncertain or negative diagnosis. We established a high priority gene list of 53 genes, evaluated exome capture kit performance, and determined the coverage for these genes and disease-related variants. We identified likely disease causing variants in 5 of the 21 probands (23.8%) and variants of uncertain significance in 52% of patients studied. In conclusion, ES has the potential to molecularly diagnose causes of IPD, and to identify candidate genes for functional evaluation.

27441947,The impact of mosaicism in preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD): approaches to PGD for dominant disorders in couples without family history.,"OBJECTIVES: Mosaicism in certain dominant disorders may result in a 'non-Mendelian' transmission for the causative mutation. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is available for patients with inherited disorders to achieve an unaffected pregnancy. We present our experience for two female patients with different dominantly inherited autosomal disorders; neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and tuberous sclerosis complex type 2 (TSC2). METHODS: PGD protocol development was carried out using single cells from the patients. PGD was carried out on polar bodies and different embryonic cells. RESULTS: Protocol development for NF1 using lymphocytes from the patient suggested mosaicism for the mutation. This was supported further by quantitative fluorescent-PCR performed on genomic DNA. During PGD, polar bodies and blastomeres lacked the mutation that probably was absent or present at very low levels in the patient's germline. Single lymphocyte analysis during protocol development for TSC2 did not indicate mosaicism; however, analysis of single buccal cells and multiple embryo biopsies across two consecutive IVF/PGD cycles confirmed gonosomal mosaicism. CONCLUSIONS: The trend in PGD is for blastocyst biopsy followed by whole genome amplification, eliminating single cell analysis. In the case of certain dominantly inherited disorders, pre-PGD single cell analysis is beneficial to identify potential mosaicism that ensures robust protocols.   2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\27441947.txt,0,"OBJECTIVES: Mosaicism in certain dominant disorders may result in a non-Mendelian transmission for the causative mutation.

31321084,NSD1 mutations by HPV status in head and neck cancer: differences in survival and response to DNA-damaging agents.,"BACKGROUND: Compared to HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), HPV-positive HNSCCs are associated with a favorable prognosis in part due to their improved treatment sensitivity. Inactivating mutations in NSD1 were shown to be a favorable prognostic biomarker in laryngeal cancers. Here, we characterize NSD1 mutations from the expanded The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HNSCC cohort (n = 522) and examine their prognostic implications based on HPV status of the tumor. We also begin to examine if NSD1 regulates response to platinum-based drugs and other DNA-damaging agents. METHODS: TCGA HNSCC samples were segregated by HPV and NSD1 mutations using cBioPortal and patient survival was determined. Pathogenicity of mutations was predicted using UMD-Predictor. NSD1-depleted cell lines were established by transfection with control or shRNAs against NSD1, followed by puromycin selection, and confirmed by qRT-PCR. Cell sensitivity to DNA damaging agents was assessed using short-term proliferation and long-term clonogenic survival assays. RESULTS: Among 457 HPV(-) tumors, 13% contained alterations in the NSD1 gene. The majority (61.3%) of NSD1 gene alterations in HPV(-) specimens were truncating mutations within or before the enzymatic SET domain. The remaining alterations included homozygous gene deletions (6.7%), missense point mutations (30.7%) and inframe deletions (1.3%). UMD-Predictor categorized 18 of 23 missense point mutations as pathogenic. For HPV(+) HNSCC (n = 65), 6 NSD1 mutations, comprised of two truncating (33%) and 4 missense point (66%) mutations, were identified. Three of the 4 missense point mutations were predicted to be pathogenic or probably pathogenic by UMD-Predictor. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis determined significantly improved survival of HPV(-) HNSCC patients whose tumors harbored NSD1 gene alterations, as compared to patients with wild-type NSD1 tumors. Interestingly, the survival effect of NSD1 mutations observed in HPV-negative HNSCC was reversed in HPV(+) tumors. Proliferation and clonogenic survival of two HPV(-) cell lines stably expressing control or NSD1 shRNAs showed that NSD1-depleted cells were more sensitive to cisplatin and carboplatin, but not to other DNA damaging drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic alterations in NSD1 hold potential as novel prognostic biomarkers in HPV(-) head and neck cancers. NSD1 mutations in HPV(+) cancers may also play a prognostic role, although this effect must be examined in a larger cohort.

30967556,Defective homologous recombination DNA repair as therapeutic target in advanced chordoma.,"Chordomas are rare bone tumors with few therapeutic options. Here we show, using whole-exome and genome sequencing within a precision oncology program, that advanced chordomas (n = 11) may be characterized by genomic patterns indicative of defective homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair and alterations affecting HR-related genes, including, for example, deletions and pathogenic germline variants of BRCA2, NBN, and CHEK2. A mutational signature associated with HR deficiency was significantly enriched in 72.7% of samples and co-occurred with genomic instability. The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib, which is preferentially toxic to HR-incompetent cells, led to prolonged clinical benefit in a patient with refractory chordoma, and whole-genome analysis at progression revealed a PARP1 p.T910A mutation predicted to disrupt the autoinhibitory PARP1 helical domain.

The disease results from a mutation of the stem cell receptor (c-kit) in mast cells and we wondered if the function of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs; also known as MSCs or mesenchymal stem cells) might be affected by the invasion of bone marrow by mutant mast cells. As expected, BMSCs from SM patients do not have a mutation in c-kit, but they proliferate poorly. In addition, while osteogenic differentiation of the BMSCs seems to be deficient, their adipogenic potential appears to be increased. Since the hematopoietic supportive abilities of BMSCs are also important, we also studied the engraftment in NSG mice of human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors, after being co-cultured with BMSCs of healthy volunteers vs. BMSCs derived from patients with SM. BMSCs derived from the bone marrow of patients with SM could not support hematopoiesis to the extent that healthy BMSCs do. Finally, we performed an expression analysis and found significant differences between healthy and SM derived BMSCs in the expression of genes with a variety of functions, including the WNT signaling, ossification, and bone remodeling.

31199508,Identification of driver genes and somatic mutations in cell-free DNA of patients with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.,"Next-generation sequencing of cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) has emerged as promising technique for identifying minimally invasive genomic profiling of tumor cells recently. However, it remains relatively unknown in LAM disease. In our study, paired cfDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) in blood samples were obtained from 23 LAM patients and seven healthy controls to explore mutations profiles of targeted 70 cancer-related genes. As results, log2-based allele frequencies of mutations in cfDNA were significantly different from those of gDNA. By comparing the mutual mutations identified both in cfDNA and gDNA, a significant correlation was also observed. After removing mutations in gDNA, distinct somatic mutation profiles of cfDNA were observed in LAM patients. Forty of 70 targeted genes had recurrent mutations, of which ATM, BRCA2 and APC showed the highest frequency. Based on the mutation, correlation network constructed of 40 mutated genes, 11 hub genes bearing intensive interactions were highlighted, including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD50, RB1, NF1, APC, MLH3, ATM, PDGFRA, PALB2 and BLM. Expression of the hub genes showed significant clusters between LAM patients and controls and that RAD50 and BRCA2 had the strongest associations with subject phenotypes. Myogenesis and estrogen response were confirmed to be positively regulated in LAM patients.

It has shown therapeutic activity in preclinical models of influenza A and B virus infections, including strains resistant to current antiviral agents. METHODS: We conducted two randomized, double-blind, controlled trials involving otherwise healthy outpatients with acute uncomplicated influenza. After a dose-ranging (10 to 40 mg) placebo-controlled trial, we undertook a placebo- and oseltamivir-controlled trial of single, weight-based doses of baloxavir (40 or 80 mg) in patients 12 to 64 years of age during the 2016-2017 season. The dose of oseltamivir was 75 mg twice daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy end point was the time to alleviation of influenza symptoms in the intention-to-treat infected population. RESULTS: In the phase 2 trial, the median time to alleviation of influenza symptoms was 23.4 to 28.2 hours shorter in the baloxavir groups than in the placebo group (P<0.05). In the phase 3 trial, the intention-to-treat infected population included 1064 patients; 84.8 to 88.1% of patients in each group had influenza A(H3N2) infection. The median time to alleviation of symptoms was 53.7 hours (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5 to 58.5) with baloxavir, as compared with 80.2 hours (95% CI, 72.6 to 87.1) with placebo (P<0.001). The time to alleviation of symptoms was similar with baloxavir and oseltamivir. Baloxavir was associated with greater reductions in viral load 1 day after initiation of the regimen than placebo or oseltamivir. Adverse events were reported in 20.7% of baloxavir recipients, 24.6% of placebo recipients, and 24.8% of oseltamivir recipients. The emergence of polymerase acidic protein variants with I38T/M/F substitutions conferring reduced susceptibility to baloxavir occurred in 2.2% and 9.7% of baloxavir recipients in the phase 2 trial and phase 3 trial, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose baloxavir was without evident safety concerns, was superior to placebo in alleviating influenza symptoms, and was superior to both oseltamivir and placebo in reducing the viral load 1 day after initiation of the trial regimen in patients with uncomplicated influenza.

30911841,Comprehensive analysis of the characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with anti-PD-1 therapy in real-world practice.,"PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown marked responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in clinical trials. However, because such trials comprise cohorts selected based on specific criteria, it is unclear if their results represent routine clinical practice. METHODS: We examined 155 patients with advanced NSCLC who were administered either nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Yonsei Cancer Center, Korea between March 2014 and January 2019. Patient characteristics, EGFR/ALK mutation status, metastatic locations, response to ICIs, and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 64 years and 72.9% of patients were male; former or current smokers constituted 67.1% of the subjects. Adenocarcinoma was predominant (67.7%), and 50.3% of the patients underwent >= 2 previous treatments. Twenty-three patients (14.8%) were EGFR mutation- or ALK rearrangement-positive. The objective response rate (ORR) was 23.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.4-31.4%]; the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.06 (95% CI 1.893-4.21) and 10.25 (95% CI 5.39-15.11) months, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified ECOG performance status, EGFR mutation/ALK rearrangement status, liver metastasis and PD-L1 proportion as independent predictors of OS.

However, because such trials comprise cohorts selected based on specific criteria, it is unclear if their results represent routine clinical practice. METHODS: We examined 155 patients with advanced NSCLC who were administered either nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Yonsei Cancer Center, Korea between March 2014 and January 2019. Patient characteristics, EGFRALK mutation status, metastatic locations, response to ICIs, and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 64 years and 72.9 of patients were male; former or current smokers constituted 67.1 of the subjects. Adenocarcinoma was predominant (67.7), and 50.3 of the patients underwent  2 previous treatments. Twenty-three patients (14.8) were EGFR mutation- or ALK rearrangement-positive. The objective response rate (ORR) was 23.9 95 confidence interval (CI) 17.4-31.4; the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.06 (95 CI 1.893-4.21) and 10.25 (95 CI 5.39-15.11) months, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified ECOG performance status, EGFR mutationALK rearrangement status, liver metastasis and PD-L1 proportion as independent predictors of OS. Furthermore, 61.9 of the patients had adverse events of any grade; 38.1 had immune-related adverse events that were associated with PFS and OS on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The real-world ORR, PFS, OS, and adverse event profiles were comparable to previous clinical trials despite the patients different baseline characteristics.

24807696,Novel mechanism of transcriptional repression of the human ATP binding cassette transporter A1 gene in hepatic cells by the winged helix/forkhead box transcription factor A2.,"ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a key role in the biogenesis of HDL by promoting the efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid free apoA-I. Mutations in the ABCA1 gene cause Tangier disease which is characterized by near or complete absence of circulating plasma HDL. In the present study we show that the winged helix/forkhead box containing transcription factor A2 (FOXA2) shown previously to play a role in glucose and bile acid homeostasis in the liver and in energy utilization in adipose tissue is a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells. We show that the ABCA1 promoter contains three FOXA2 binding elements in the proximal region. Two of the sites are localized in a region of the ABCA1 promoter enriched in binding elements for transcriptional repressor proteins whereas the third site is the core of the TATA element of the ABCA1 promoter. Inhibition of FOXA2 binding to the ABCA1 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis or FOXA2 gene expression by siRNA was associated with increased ABCA1 promoter activity and protein levels. Overexpression of FOXA2 inhibited both the constitutive ABCA1 gene expression as well as ABCA1 gene induction by oxysterols and retinoids via nuclear receptors LXRalpha/RXRalpha. In summary, the present study identifies transcription factor FOXA2 as a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells and reveals a novel mechanism of transcriptional repression by FOXA2 which involves the TATA element of the ABCA1 gene.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\24807696.txt,0,"ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a key role in the biogenesis of HDL by promoting the efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid free apoA-I.

31354263,"Photothermal effects of NaYF4:Yb,Er@PE3@Fe3O4 superparamagnetic nanoprobes in the treatment of melanoma.","Objective: The study aimed to synthesize superparamagnetic NaYF4:Yb,Er@PE3@Fe3O4 upconversion nanoprobes and to study their photothermal effects for the treatment of malignant melanoma. Methods: Morphological characteristics of the synthesized nanoprobes were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Their biocompatibility and biodistribution profiles were assessed through blood routine/biochemistry tests and the inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectrometry-based analysis of tissue metal elements. Their photothermal conversion efficiency and their potential as contrast agents for upconversion luminescence (UCL)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dual-modal imaging were tested. Efficacy in photothermal therapy, which was achieved by combining nanoprobes with near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, was evaluated in both A375 cell line and BALB/c mice models. The underlying mechanisms were interrogated by molecular approaches including the MTT assay, flow cytometry, semiquantitative PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Results: 1) Our synthesized NaYF4:Yb,Er@PE3@Fe3O4 nanoprobes exhibited a uniform cubic morphology with a diameter of ~50 nm. Subcutaneous administration led to no severe, long-lasting adverse effects in mice, possibly due to complete removal of these nanomaterials within one month. 2) Our nanoprobes possessed superior photothermal conversion efficiency and strong contrasting effects during UCL/MRI dual-modal imaging, corroborating their applications in imaging-guided photothermal therapy. 3) Combinatorial treatment of these nanoprobes with NIR irradiation induced profound apoptosis/necrosis in A375 cells. Similarly, the same treatment modality led to strong therapeutic effects in BALB/c mice implanted with A375 tumor xenografts. Mechanistic studies suggested an involvement of heat shock protein 70 in mediating the observed antitumor effects of our nanoprobes. Conclusion: Our study describes a convenient method to synthesize a new type of superparamagnetic upconversion nanoprobes, which possess high biocompatibility and can be used in imaging-guided photothermal therapy for the treatment of malignant melanoma.

This study aimed to evaluate the relative contribution of patient condition and mutational status in peripheral blood when added to the IPSS-R, for estimating overall survival and the risk of leukemic transformation in patients with MDS. A prospective cohort (2006-2015) of 200 consecutive patients with MDS were included in the study series and categorized according to the IPSS-R. Patients were further stratified according to patient condition (assessed using the multidimensional Lee index for older adults) and genetic mutations (peripheral blood samples screened using next-generation sequencing). The change in likelihood-ratio was tested in Cox models after adding individual covariates. The addition of the Lee index to the IPSS-R significantly improved prediction of overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) 3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-4.66, P < 0.001), and mutational analysis significantly improved prediction of leukemic evolution (HR 2.64, 1.56-4.46, P < 0.001).

RESULTS: The accuracy of genomic prediction improved marginally from 0.16 +- 0.02 and 0.18 +- 0.01 when using all the variants from 50k and HD genotypes, respectively, to 0.19 +- 0.01 when using all the variants from WGS data. Fitting a GRM from the selected variants alongside a GRM from the 50k SNP genotypes improved the prediction accuracy substantially compared to fitting the 50k SNP genotypes alone. The gain in prediction accuracy was slightly more pronounced when variants were selected from WGS data compared to when variants were selected from the HD panel. When sequence variants that passed the GWAS [Formula: see text] threshold of 3 across the entire genome were selected, the prediction accuracy improved by 5% (up to 0.21 +- 0.01), whereas when selection was limited to sequence variants that passed the same GWAS [Formula: see text] threshold of 3 in regions identified by RHM, the accuracy improved by 9% (up to 0.25 +- 0.01).

31248416,Identification of novel pathogenic MSH2 mutation and new DNA repair genes variants: investigation of a Tunisian Lynch syndrome family with discordant twins.,"BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome (LS) is a highly penetrant inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes. Despite several genetic variations that have been identified in various populations, the penetrance is highly variable and the reasons for this have not been fully elucidated. This study investigates whether, besides pathogenic mutations, environment and low penetrance genetic risk factors may result in phenotype modification in a Tunisian LS family. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Tunisian family with strong colorectal cancer (CRC) history that fulfill the Amsterdam I criteria for the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome was proposed for oncogenetic counseling. The index case was a man, diagnosed at the age of 33 years with CRC. He has a monozygotic twin diagnosed at the age of 35 years with crohn disease. Forty-seven years-old was the onset age of his paternal uncle withCRC. An immunohistochemical (IHC) labeling for the four proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) of the MisMatchRepair (MMR) system was performed for the index case. A targeted sequencing of MSH2, MLH1 and a panel of 85 DNA repair genes was performed for the index case and for his unaffected father. RESULTS: The IHC results showed a loss of MSH2 but not MLH1, MSH6 and PMS2 proteins expression. Genomic DNA screening, by targeted DNA repair genes sequencing, revealed an MSH2 pathogenic mutation (c.1552C>T; p.Q518X), confirmed by Sanger sequencing. This mutation was suspected to be a causal mutation associated to the loss of MSH2 expression and it was found in first and second degree relatives. The index case has smoking and alcohol consumption habits. Moreover, he harbors extensive genetic variations in other DNA-repair genes not shared with his unaffected father. CONCLUSION: In our investigated Tunisian family, we confirmed the LS by IHC, molecular and in silico investigations. We identified a novel pathogenic mutation described for the first time in Tunisia. These results come enriching the previously reported pathogenic mutations in LS families. Our study brings new arguments to the interpretation of MMR expression pattern and highlights new risk modifiers genes eventually implicated in CRC.

31032472,"Genomic Assessment of Blood-Derived Circulating Tumor DNA in Patients With Colorectal Cancers: Correlation With Tissue Sequencing, Therapeutic Response, and Survival.","PURPOSE: Genomic alterations in blood-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with colorectal cancers were correlated with clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Next-generation sequencing of ctDNA (54- to 73-gene panel) was performed in 94 patients with colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Most patients (96%) had metastatic or recurrent disease at the time of blood draw. The median number of nonsynonymous alterations per patient was three (range, zero to 30). The most frequently aberrant genes were TP53 (52.1% of patients), KRAS (34%), and APC (28.7%). Concordance between tissue and blood next-generation sequencing ranged from 63.2% (APC) to 85.5% (BRAF). Altogether, 74 patients (79%) had one or more nonsynonymous alterations, 69 (73%) had one or more potentially actionable alterations, and 61 (65%) had an alteration actionable by a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (on or off label). Lung metastases correlated with improved survival from diagnosis in univariable analysis. ctDNA of 5% or more from blood tests as well as EGFR and ERBB2 (HER2) nonsynonymous alterations correlated with worse survival (but only ERBB2 remained significant in multivariable analysis). No two patients had identical molecular portfolios. Overall, 65% versus 31% of patients treated with matched (n = 17) versus unmatched therapy (n = 18) after ctDNA testing achieved stable disease for 6 months or more, partial response, or complete response (P = .045); progression-free survival, 6.1 versus 2.3 months (P = .08); and survival not reached versus 9.4 months (P = .146; all by multivariable analysis).

31569934,Modern view on epidermal dysplasia carcinogenesis.,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin develops from the spectrum of facultative precancerous conditions, which in the course of malignant transformation through cancer stage in situ without early treatment fully transform into invasive squamous cell carcinoma. According to classical model of carcinogenesis, the transformation of actinic keratosis into squamous cell carcinoma of the skin occurs due to a mutation in one gene, more often a tumor suppressor, and undergoes a stage of development with lack of control of cell cycle. The aim of the research is to supplement current knowledge of genetic determination of pathogenetic mechanisms of epidermal dysplasia of the skin by studying the genetic determinant in the skin lesion of varying degrees of malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 85 skin bioptates of patients with epidermal dysplasia of the skin (Gr 1 - 43 patients with actinic keratosis; Gr 2 - 21 patients with non-invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; Gr 3 - 21 patients with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) by molecular genetic testing of gene polymorphisms: TP53 (G13494A), L-myc (T3109G), TNF-alpha (G308A) in tumor tissue. The histological examination revealed the levels of dysplasia of the epidermis. RESULTS: In case of the same disease duration in patients of Gr1/Gr3, L-myc (3109TT) is a genetic component of malignant transformation of epithelial skin cells (p = 0.004) and the development of invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Other variants of 3109TG and 3109GG genes do not have such prognostic value for the risk of skin cancer compared to 3109TT. Significant differences were found in the distribution of (13494GA) when comparing Gr 1 with Gr 3 (p = 0.014) and Gr 2 with Gr 3 (p = 0.038). A significant increase in the distribution of 13494GA genotype was revealed in patients with invasive form of keratinocyte intraepidermal neoplasia. 13494A allele was more likely to be detected in patients of Gr 3 compared to Gr 2 (p = 0.030) that proves the association of this allele with the development of invasive malignancies of the skin. The association of 308GG genotype and TNF-alpha (308G) allele with the development of malignant skin lesions was found. Comparing the distribution of 308G allele in patients of Gr 1 and Gr 2, we found its significant increase in patients of Gr 1.

No germline gene mutations associated with colorectal adenomatous polyposis, including APC regulator of WNT signaling pathway, mutY DNA glycosylase, DNA polymerase-epsilon, catalytic subunit, DNA polymerase delta1, catalytic subunit, and mismatch repair genes, were detected via germline genetic testing. A heterozygous germline mutation in methyl-CpG binding domain 4, DNA glycosylase (MBD4), c.217C>T/p.Gln73*, which resulted in the generation of a stop codon, was identified by genetic analyses including whole-exome sequencing. Immunohistochemical staining analysis revealed that the expression of MBD4 protein was absent in the cancer tissue, while it was expressed in the normal epithelium. Sequencing and copy-number analyses demonstrated the loss of the remaining allele of MBD4 in the cancer tissue. Furthermore, somatic mutation signature analysis showed preferential transition of cytosine to thymine residues at CpG dinucleotides in cancer tissues. Although it has been previously reported that germline missense mutations and somatic mutations of MBD4 are associated with the development of colorectal cancer, this is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, in which a germline nonsense mutation of the MBD4 gene has been identified in an early-onset colorectal cancer patient with oligopolyposis.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31322271.txt,1,"A 42-year-old woman presented with 30 adenomatous polyps of the left sided-colon with early rectosigmoid cancer.

28880435,Thrombocytopenia and CD34 expression is decoupled from alpha-granule deficiency with mutation of the first growth factor-independent 1B zinc finger.,"Essentials The phenotypes of different growth factor-independent 1B (GFI1B) variants are not established. GFI1B variants produce heterogeneous clinical phenotypes dependent on the site of mutation. Mutation of the first non-DNA-binding zinc-finger causes a mild platelet and clinical phenotype. GFI1B regulates the CD34 promoter; platelet CD34 expression is an indicator of GFI1B mutation. SUMMARY: Background Mutation of the growth factor-independent 1B (GFI1B) fifth DNA-binding zinc-finger domain causes macrothrombocytopenia and alpha-granule deficiency leading to clinical bleeding. The phenotypes associated with GFI1B variants disrupting non-DNA-binding zinc-fingers remain uncharacterized. Objectives To determine the functional and phenotypic consequences of GFI1B variants disrupting non-DNA-binding zinc-finger domains. Methods The GFI1B C168F variant and a novel GFI1B c.2520 + 1_2520 + 8delGTGGGCAC splice variant were identified in four unrelated families. Phenotypic features, DNA-binding properties and transcriptional effects were determined and compared with those in individuals with a GFI1B H294 fs mutation of the fifth DNA-binding zinc-finger. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived megakaryocytes were generated to facilitate disease modeling. Results The DNA-binding GFI1B variant C168F, which is predicted to disrupt the first non-DNA-binding zinc-finger domain, is associated with macrothrombocytopenia without alpha-granule deficiency or bleeding symptoms. A GFI1B splice variant, c.2520 + 1_2520 + 8delGTGGGCAC, which generates a short GFI1B isoform that lacks non-DNA-binding zinc-fingers 1 and 2, is associated with increased platelet CD34 expression only, without quantitative or morphologic platelet abnormalities. GFI1B represses the CD34 promoter, and this repression is attenuated by different GFI1B zinc-finger mutations, suggesting that deregulation of CD34 expression occurs at a direct transcriptional level. Patient-specific iPSC-derived megakaryocytes phenocopy these observations.

Histological examination and immunohistochemical studies in the explanted liver revealed prominent foamy histiocytes that were CD68 positive, but CD1a and S100 negative. Mutational hotspot analysis of the explanted liver using a panel of 47 most common cancer-related genes performed by next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed likely somatic mutations in the PDGFRA, PTEN, and HNF1A genes, but no BRAF codon 600 mutations were detected. The bone marrow showed similar findings as in the liver. Whole body PET and bone scans demonstrated increased heterogeneous uptake in bilateral humeral and femoral diaphysis, most compatible with ECD.

28475226,Molecular cytogenetic characterization of five F8 complex rearrangements: utility for haemophilia A genetic counselling.,"BACKGROUND: Genomic inversions are usually balanced, but unusual patterns have been described in haemophilia A (HA) patients for intron 22 (Inv22) and intron 1 (Inv1) inversions leading to the hypothesis of more complex rearrangements involving deletions or duplications. AIM: To characterize five abnormal patterns either in Southern blot and long-range PCR for Inv22 or in PCR for Inv1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients were studied using cytogenetic microarray analysis (CMA). RESULTS: In all cases, CMA analysis found that each inversion was associated with complex Xq28 rearrangement. In three patients, CMA analysis showed large duplication ranging from 230 to 1302 kb and encompassing a various number of contiguous genes among which RAB39B. RAB39B duplication is a strong candidate gene for X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Surprisingly, none of the severe HA patients with RAB39B duplication reported in this study or in the literature exhibited XLID. We hypothesise that F8 complex rearrangement down regulated RAB39B expression. In the two remaining patients, CMA analysis found Xq28 large deletion (from 285 to 522 kb). Moyamoya syndrome was strongly suspected in one of them who carried BRCC3 deletion. CONCLUSION: Because several F8 neighbouring genes are associated with other pathologies such as XLID and cardiovascular disease, all HA patients where complex Xq28 rearrangement was suspected should be referred to a geneticist for possible utility of a pangenomic study.

Vaccines with adenoviral vectors have been rarely associated with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).
This study aimed to describe 15 cases of VITT after the third and fourth doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil.
Cases were reported after all kinds of anti-SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccinations between October 17, 2021, and September 4, 2022.
Of the 26 suspected cases, 15 cases of VITT were analyzed. Of these, 10 were classified as definite VITT, 2 as probable, 1 as possible, and 2 as unlikely. The estimated frequency of definite, probable, or possible VITT was 0.33 cases per million. Cases were assigned to ChAdOx1 (13 cases), Ad26.COV2.S (1 case), and BNT162b2 (1 case). None of the patients received an adenoviral vaccine as a primary vaccination. The average age of participants was 34 years, and symptoms usually appeared 8 days after vaccination. Headache was the most common symptom, and cerebral veins were the most affected thrombotic site. The overall mortality risk was 53%. Anti-platelet factor 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology was positive in 11 out of 15 patients (73.3%), negative in 2 (13.3%), and missing in 2 (13.3%).
The study confirms that VITT is linked to the first exposure to adenoviral vector vaccines. Since January 2023, Brazil has recommended preferably COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines for individuals aged 18 to 39 years.

Of these, 10 were classified as definite VITT, 2 as probable, 1 as possible, and 2 as unlikely. The estimated frequency of definite, probable, or possible VITT was 0.33 cases per million. Cases were assigned to ChAdOx1 (13 cases), Ad26.COV2.S (1 case), and BNT162b2 (1 case). None of the patients received an adenoviral vaccine as a primary vaccination. The average age of participants was 34 years, and symptoms usually appeared 8 days after vaccination. Headache was the most common symptom, and cerebral veins were the most affected thrombotic site. The overall mortality risk was 53. Anti-platelet factor 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology was positive in 11 out of 15 patients (73.3), negative in 2 (13.3), and missing in 2 (13.3). The study confirms that VITT is linked to the first exposure to adenoviral vector vaccines. Since January 2023, Brazil has recommended preferably COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines for individuals aged 18 to 39 years. We suggest that, in the current disease scenario, COVID-19 adenovirus vaccines should not be the first choice for individuals aged 50 years who have not received a previous dose of this type of vaccine.",[],0

29133782,mTOR intersects antibody-inducing signals from TACI in marginal zone B cells.,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) enhances immunity in addition to orchestrating metabolism. Here we show that mTOR coordinates immunometabolic reconfiguration of marginal zone (MZ) B cells, a pre-activated lymphocyte subset that mounts antibody responses to T-cell-independent antigens through a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-amplified pathway involving transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI). This receptor interacts with mTOR via the TLR adapter MyD88. The resulting mTOR activation instigates MZ B-cell proliferation, immunoglobulin G (IgG) class switching, and plasmablast differentiation through a rapamycin-sensitive pathway that integrates metabolic and antibody-inducing transcription programs, including NF-kappaB. Disruption of TACI-mTOR interaction by rapamycin, truncation of the MyD88-binding domain of TACI, or B-cell-conditional mTOR deficiency interrupts TACI signaling via NF-kappaB and cooperation with TLRs, thereby hampering IgG production to T-cell-independent antigens but not B-cell survival. Thus, mTOR drives innate-like antibody responses by linking proximal TACI signaling events with distal immunometabolic transcription programs.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\29133782.txt,0,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) enhances immunity in addition to orchestrating metabolism.

31647020,A rare simultaneous coexistence of epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumors and schwannoma in the stomach: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), a type of mesenchymal tumor in the gastrointestinal tract, are believed to be closely associated with PDGFRA and C-KIT mutations. Schwannoma in the stomach, which is an unusual location, is a rare disorder. The simultaneous occurrence of the two diseases is rarer than metachronous occurrences, and its pathological characteristics have not been reported to date. We present a case report on a patient with simultaneous coexistence of gastric schwannoma and GISTs. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old female visited our hospital complaining of intermittent abdominal pain for the previous 3 months. CT revealed a 3.4 cm slight homogeneous enhancement in the lesser curvature of the stomach; the mass was nodular soft tissue, which was removed by radical surgery. Two solid tumors with different volumes were located in the stomach. Histologically and immunohistochemically different, the larger tumor consisted of spindle cells surrounded by a peripheral lymphoid cuff, and was positive for S-100. The larger tumor was therefore classified as a gastric schwannoma. The smaller tumor was composed of medium-sized round, oval cells with amphiphilic granular cytoplasm; vacuolization was also observed. The tumor cells were positive for DOG1 and sporadically positive for CD34 and CD117. Hence, the smaller tumor was diagnosed as epithelioid GISTs. Sanger sequencing revealed that the GIST tumor cells contained a deletion mutation (c.2527_2538 del12,843-846del4), which was located in exon 18 of PDGFRA. CONCLUSION: GISTs combined with gastric schwannoma are a considerably rare subgroup of gastric tumors. Related clinical research is comparatively weak, and the mechanism remains unknown. We reviewed related articles to provide knowledge to improve the correct identification, diagnosis and management of patients with gastric cancer.

Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a key factor that affects T cell function and immune response. However, whether the expression of CTLA-4 affects the severity of psoriasis is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the project was to investigate the correlation between the expression of CTLA-4 and the severity of psoriasis. METHODS: The plasma soluble CTLA-4 levels and membrane CTLA-4 expression were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry analysis in mild, moderate and severe psoriasis patients, respectively. Imiquimod-induced mouse model of psoriasis was treated with CTLA-4 immunoglobulin fusion protein (CTLA-4 Ig) or anti-CTLA-4 antibody. Epidermal thickness and infiltrating CD3+ T cell counts were evaluated. RESULTS: The plasma soluble CTLA-4 levels had no significant difference among mild, moderate, and severe patients (p > 0.05). However, the membrane CTLA-4 expression in skin was significantly higher in mild psoriasis patients compared to moderate and severe psoriasis patients (17652.86 +- 18095.66 vs 6901.36 +- 4400.77 vs 3970.24 +- 5509.15, p < 0.001).

27259010,CTNNB1 Mutations and Estrogen Receptor Expression in Neuromuscular Choristoma and Its Associated Fibromatosis.,"Neuromuscular choristoma (NMC) is a very rare, developmental malformation characterized by the endoneurial intercalation of mature muscle fibers among peripheral nerve fibers. NMC typically arises in the major proximal peripheral nerves, most commonly the sciatic nerve, and may involve the lumbosacral and brachial plexus. Patients present clinically with progressive neuropathy or plexopathy. NMC is strongly associated with development of a fibromatosis, histologically identical to conventional desmoid-type fibromatosis (NMC-fibromatosis). The development of NMC-fibromatosis is often precipitated by iatrogenic trauma (ie, biopsy). Desmoid-type fibromatosis is characterized by CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, which result in aberrant nuclear beta-catenin localization and dysregulated canonical Wnt signaling. In contrast, the pathogenesis of NMC and NMC-fibromatosis is unknown. Desmoid-type fibromatosis expresses estrogen receptors (ER), specifically the ER-beta isoform (ERbeta), and endocrine therapies may be used in surgically unresectable cases.

NMC typically arises in the major proximal peripheral nerves, most commonly the sciatic nerve, and may involve the lumbosacral and brachial plexus. Patients present clinically with progressive neuropathy or plexopathy. NMC is strongly associated with development of a fibromatosis, histologically identical to conventional desmoid-type fibromatosis (NMC-fibromatosis). The development of NMC-fibromatosis is often precipitated by iatrogenic trauma (ie, biopsy). Desmoid-type fibromatosis is characterized by CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, which result in aberrant nuclear beta-catenin localization and dysregulated canonical Wnt signaling. In contrast, the pathogenesis of NMC and NMC-fibromatosis is unknown. Desmoid-type fibromatosis expresses estrogen receptors (ER), specifically the ER-beta isoform (ERbeta), and endocrine therapies may be used in surgically unresectable cases.

As CHIP-associated mutations are known to alter the development and function of myeloid cells, we hypothesized that CHIP may also be associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disease in which brain-resident myeloid cells are thought to have a major role. To perform association tests between CHIP and AD dementia, we analyzed blood DNA sequencing data from 1,362 individuals with AD and 4,368 individuals without AD. Individuals with CHIP had a lower risk of AD dementia (meta-analysis odds ratio (OR) = 0.64, P = 3.8 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), and Mendelian randomization analyses supported a potential causal association. We observed that the same mutations found in blood were also detected in microglia-enriched fraction of the brain in seven of eight CHIP carriers. Single-nucleus chromatin accessibility profiling of brain-derived nuclei in six CHIP carriers revealed that the mutated cells comprised a large proportion of the microglial pool in the samples examined.

We demonstrated the cellular uptake of MGL liposomes into murine cells derived from colon cancer (Colon 26 cells) using flow cytometry, and we found that the uptake was governed by a clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway. Confocal fluorescence microscopic observations of Colon 26 cells treated with MGL liposomes encapsulating DOX revealed that DOX was localized in endosomes under dark conditions, while DOX was observed in the cytosol and nucleus after UV irradiation.

31316083,SREBP1-dependent de novo fatty acid synthesis gene expression is elevated in malignant melanoma and represents a cellular survival trait.,"de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (DNFA) is a hallmark adaptation of many cancers that supports survival, proliferation, and metastasis. Here we elucidate previously unexplored aspects of transcription regulation and clinical relevance of DNFA in cancers. We show that elevated expression of DNFA genes is characteristic of many tumor types and correlates with poor prognosis, especially in melanomas. Elevated DNFA gene expression depends on the SREBP1 transcription factor in multiple melanoma cell lines. SREBP1 predominantly binds to the transcription start sites of DNFA genes, regulating their expression by recruiting RNA polymerase II to promoters for productive transcription elongation. We find that SREBP1-regulated DNFA represents a survival trait in melanoma cells, regardless of proliferative state and oncogenic mutation status. Indeed, malignant melanoma cells exhibit elevated DNFA gene expression after the BRAF/MEK signaling pathway is blocked (e.g. by BRAF inhibitors), and DNFA expression remains higher in melanoma cells resistant to vemurafenib treatment than in untreated cells. Accordingly, DNFA pathway inhibition, whether by direct targeting of SREBP1 with antisense oligonucleotides, or through combinatorial effects of multiple DNFA enzyme inhibitors, exerts potent cytotoxic effects on both BRAFi-sensitive and -resistant melanoma cells. Altogether, these results implicate SREBP1 and DNFA enzymes as enticing therapeutic targets in melanomas.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31316083.txt,1,"de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (DNFA) is a hallmark adaptation of many cancers that supports survival, proliferation, and metastasis.

The precise role of mTOR in the control of regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation and function is complex. Pharmacologic inhibition and genetic deletion of mTOR promotes the generation of Tregs even under conditions that would normally promote generation of effector T cells. Alternatively, mTOR activity has been observed to be increased in Tregs, and the genetic deletion of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-scaffold protein Raptor inhibits Treg function. In this study, by employing both pharmacologic inhibitors and genetically altered T cells, we seek to clarify the role of mTOR in Tregs. Our studies demonstrate that inhibition of mTOR during T cell activation promotes the generation of long-lived central Tregs with a memory-like phenotype in mice. Metabolically, these central memory Tregs possess enhanced spare respiratory capacity, similar to CD8+ memory cells. Alternatively, the generation of effector Tregs (eTregs) requires mTOR function.

31152596,The role of gene fusions in melanocytic neoplasms.,"Recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed for efficient whole transcriptome sequencing, leading to the identification of important kinase fusions as the primary driver in some melanocytic neoplasms. These fusions typically occur mutually exclusively of one another and other well-known initiating mutations such as BRAF, NRAS, NF1, KIT, and GNAQ. Fusions are found in over 50% of Spitz neoplasms, including ALK, BRAF, NTRK1, NTRK3, ROS1, MET, MAP3K8, and RET. Familiarity with the typical morphologic features of certain fusion-driven melanocytic neoplasms can help with classification, diagnosis, and identification of targeted molecular therapies in malignant cases. Spitz tumors with ALK, NTRK1, and NTRK3 fusions have characteristic morphologic features. BRAF and MAP3K8 fusions, in particular, tend to be epithelioid, high grade, and more frequent in Spitz melanoma than other fusion subtypes. Sporadic cases of pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma may have PRKCA fusions and sheets of monomorphic epithelioid melanocytes. Fusion events are also enriched among melanomas without the key mutations BRAF, NRAS, or NF1.

Treatment recommendations are based on smaller case series, with selection bias towards symptomatic patients. OBJECTIVE: To define the natural history of renal AML, including growth rates, size, and clinical presentation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used a unique radiology data-mining system (Montage; Montage Healthcare Systems, Philadelphia, PA, USA) to retrospectively review the radiology database in an academic health centre between 2002 and 2013 to identify all renal AMLs. Of 2741 patients identified, 447 with 582 AMLs had three or more imaging studies suitable for analysis. INTERVENTION: Angioembolisation, surgery, radiofrequency ablation, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary end point was the growth rate of untreated AMLs. We used a linear mixed-effects model to determine change in growth rate over time. We evaluated the association among growth rate, size, and patient factors as well as interventions. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The majority of untreated AMLs (>92%) had not grown at a median follow-up of 43 mo, with no difference in growth rates between AMLs <=4 and >4cm. Most AMLs occurred in female participants (80%) and were asymptomatic (91%). Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) was confirmed in 3.8% (n=17) and presented at an earlier age. Median size was 1cm but was significantly larger for TSC (5.5cm; p<0.001). Interventions were performed in 5.6% of patients. Limitations of our study include the retrospective design, selection against fat-poor AMLs, and lack of histology. CONCLUSIONS: This large, single-institution series on AMLs confirms that lesions >4cm do not require early intervention based on size alone. The vast majority are sporadic, asymptomatic, and initially harmless, with a negligible growth rate. Our findings support a policy of initial active surveillance for all asymptomatic AMLs.

To better understand how chromatin regulates AGSC biology and gametogenesis, we derived stage-specific high-resolution profiles of DNA methylation, 5hmC, histone modifications/variants, and RNA-seq in AGSCs and during spermatogenesis. First, we define striking signaling and transcriptional differences between AGSC types, involving key self-renewal and proliferation pathways. Second, key pluripotency factors (e.g., Nanog) are silent in AGSCs and bear particular chromatin/DNAme attributes that may ""poise"" them for reactivation after fertilization. Third, AGSCs display chromatin ""poising/bivalency"" of enhancers and promoters for embryonic transcription factors. Remarkably, gametogenesis occurs without significant changes in DNAme and instead involves transcription of DNA-methylated promoters bearing high RNAPol2, H3K9ac, H3K4me3, low CG content, and (often) 5hmC.

First, we define striking signaling and transcriptional differences between AGSC types, involving key self-renewal and proliferation pathways. Second, key pluripotency factors (e.g., Nanog) are silent in AGSCs and bear particular chromatinDNAme attributes that may poise them for reactivation after fertilization. Third, AGSCs display chromatin poisingbivalency of enhancers and promoters for embryonic transcription factors. Remarkably, gametogenesis occurs without significant changes in DNAme and instead involves transcription of DNA-methylated promoters bearing high RNAPol2, H3K9ac, H3K4me3, low CG content, and (often) 5hmC. Furthermore, key findings were confirmed in human sperm.

27012200,R-spondin 2 facilitates differentiation of proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes by enhancing Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in endochondral ossification.,"Endochondral ossification is a crucial process for longitudinal growth of bones. Differentiating chondrocytes in growth cartilage form four sequential zones of proliferation, alignment into column, hypertrophy, and substitution of chondrocytes with osteoblasts. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is essential for differentiation of proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes in growth cartilage. R-spondin 2 (Rspo2), a member of R-spondin family, is an agonist for Wnt signaling, but its role in chondrocyte differentiation remains unknown. Here we report that growth cartilage of Rspo2-knockout mice shows a decreased amount of beta-catenin and increased amounts collagen type II (CII) and Sox9 in the abnormally extended proliferating zone. In contrast, expression of collagen type X (CX) in the hypertrophic zone remains unchanged. Differentiating chondrogenic ATDC5 cells, mimicking proliferating chondrocytes, upregulate Rspo2 and its putative receptor, Lgr5, in parallel. Addition of recombinant human Rspo2 to differentiating ATDC5 cells decreases expressions of Col2a1, Sox9, and Acan, as well as production of proteoglycans. In contrast, lentivirus-mediated knockdown of Rspo2 has the opposite effect. The effect of Rspo2 on chondrogenic differentiation is mediated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and not by Wnt/PCP or Wnt/Ca(2+) signaling. We propose that Rspo2 activates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling to reduce Col2a1 and Sox9 and to facilitate differentiation of proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes in growth cartilage.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\27012200.txt,0,"Endochondral ossification is a crucial process for longitudinal growth of bones.

24850616,A limited form of proteus syndrome with bilateral plantar cerebriform collagenomas and varicose veins secondary to a mosaic AKT1 mutation.,"IMPORTANCE: Proteus syndrome is an extremely rare disorder of mosaic postnatal overgrowth affecting multiple tissues including bone, soft tissue, and skin. It typically manifests in early childhood with asymmetric and progressive skeletal overgrowth that leads to severe distortion of the skeleton and disability. The genetic basis has recently been identified as a somatic activating mutation in the AKT1 gene, which encodes an enzyme mediating cell proliferation and apoptosis. OBSERVATIONS: We present a 33-year-old man who developed plantar cerebriform collagenomas on the soles of both feet and varicose veins in early childhood, in the absence of any skeletal or other connective tissue abnormality. Although the patient did not meet the diagnostic criteria for Proteus syndrome, he was found to have the c.49G>A, p.Glu17Lys AKT1 mutation in lesional skin but not in his blood. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the mildest molecularly confirmed case of Proteus syndrome, occurring in the absence of the characteristic skeletal overgrowth.

Participants in the Young Women's Breast Cancer Study (NCT01468246), a prospective cohort of women diagnosed with breast cancer at ≤40 years, who completed a modified Fertility Issues Survey were included in this analysis.
Of 1052 eligible participants, 118 (11%) tested positive for a pathogenic variant. Similar proportions (P = .23) of carriers (46%, [54/118]) and noncarriers (37%, [346/934]) desired more biologic children prediagnosis, and desire decreased similarly postdiagnosis (carriers, 30% [35/118] vs. noncarriers, 26% [244/934], P = .35). Among those desiring children postdiagnosis (n = 279), concern about cancer risk heritability was more common among carriers (74% [26/35] vs. noncarriers, 36% [88/244], P < .01). Carriers were more likely to report that concern about cancer risk heritability contributed to a lack of certainty or interest in future pregnancies (20% [16/81] vs. noncarriers, 7% [49/674], P = .001).

31413087,IL6R-STAT3-ADAR1 (P150) interplay promotes oncogenicity in multiple myeloma with 1q21 amplification.,"1q21 amplification is an important prognostic marker in multiple myeloma. In this study we identified that IL6R (the interleukin-6 membrane receptor) and ADAR1 (an RNA editing enzyme) are critical genes located within the minimally amplified 1q21 region. Loss of individual genes caused suppression to the oncogenic phenotypes, the magnitude of which was enhanced when both genes were concomitantly lost. Mechanistically, IL6R and ADAR1 collaborated to induce a hyper-activation of the oncogenic STAT3 pathway. High IL6R confers hypersensitivity to interleukin-6 binding, whereas, ADAR1 forms a constitutive feed-forward loop with STAT3 in a P150-isoform-predominant manner. In this respect, ADAR1-P150 acts as a direct transcriptional target for STAT3 and this STAT3-induced-P150 in turn directly interacts with and stabilizes the former protein, leading to a larger pool of proteins acting as oncogenic transcription factors for pro-survival genes. The importance of both IL6R and ADAR1-P150 in STAT3 signaling was further validated when concomitant knockdown of both genes impeded IL6-induced-STAT3 pathway activation. Clinical evaluation of various datasets of myeloma patients showed that low expression of either one or both genes was closely associated with a compromised STAT3 signature, confirming the involvement of IL6R and ADAR1 in the STAT3 pathway and underscoring their essential role in disease pathogenesis. In summary, our findings highlight the complexity of the STAT3 pathway in myeloma, in association with 1q21 amplification.

The benzotriazine-1-monoxide (BTMO) metabolite (SR 4317, TPZMO) of TPZ also has radiosensitizing properties, and via unknown mechanisms, is a potent enhancer of the radiosensitizing effects of TPZ. Unlike their 2-nitroimidazole radiosensitizer counterparts, radiolabeled benzotriazine oxides have not been used as radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic imaging or molecular radiotherapy (MRT) of hypoxia. The radioiodination chemistry for preparing model radioiodinated BTDOs and BTMOs is now reported. Hypothesis: Radioiodinated 3-(2-iodoethoxyethyl)-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4-dioxide (I-EOE-TPZ), a novel bioisosteric analogue of TPZ, and 3-(2-iodoethoxyethyl)-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1-oxide (I-EOE-TPZMO), its monoxide analogue, are candidates for in vivo and in vitro investigations of biochemical mechanisms in pathologies that develop hypoxic microenvironments. In theory, both radiotracers can be prepared from the same precursors. Methods: Radioiodination procedures were based on classical nucleophilic [131I]iodide substitution on Tos-EOE-TPZ (P1) and by [131I]iodide exchange on I-EOE-TPZ (P2). Reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, solvent and the influence of pivalic acid on products' formation and the corresponding radiochemical yields (RCY) were investigated. Results: The [131I]iodide labeling reactions invariably led to the synthesis of both products, but with careful manipulation of conditions the preferred product could be recovered as the major product. Radioiodide exchange on P2 in ACN at 80 +- 5  C for 30 min afforded the highest RCY, 89%, of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ, which upon solid phase purification on an alumina cartridge gave 60% yield of the product with over 97% of radiochemical purity. Similarly, radioiodide exchange on P2 in ACN at 50 +- 5  C for 30 min with pivalic acid afforded the highest yield, 92%, of [131I]I-EOE-TPZMO exclusively with no trace of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ. In both cases, extended reaction times and/or elevated temperatures resulted in the formation of at least two additional radioactive reaction products. Conclusions: Radioiodination of P1 and P2 with [131I]iodide leads to the facile formation of [131I]I-EOE-TPZMO.

Recent findings have highlighted the heterogeneity among diffuse midline gliomas with different locations and ages. Compared to tumors located in the brain stem and thalamus, the molecular and clinicopathological features of H3 K27-altered spinal cord glioma are still largely elusive, thus hindering the accurate management of patients. Here we aimed to characterize the clinicopathological and molecular features of H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord glioma in 77 consecutive cases. We found that the H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord glioma, with a median age of 35 years old, had a significantly better prognosis than H3 K27M-mutant brain tumors. We noticed a molecular heterogeneity of H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord astrocytoma via targeted sequencing with 34 cases. TP53 mutation which occurred in 58.8% of cases is mutually exclusive with PPM1D (26%) and NF1 (44%) mutations. The TP53-mutant cases had a significantly higher number of copy number variants (CNV) and a marginally higher proportion of pediatric patients (age at diagnosis <18 years old, p = 0.056). Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that the higher number of CNV events (≥3), chromosome (Chr) 9p deletion, Chr 10p deletion, ATRX mutation, CDK6 amplification, and retinoblastoma protein (RB) pathway alteration are associated with worse survival.

The proportion of tall cells needed to influence prognosis is debated. METHODS: Patients with PTC and tall cells, defined as having a height-to-width ratio of >= 3:1, seen at a high-volume center between 2001 and 2015, were reviewed. Specimens were classified as (1) focal tall cell change, containing < 30% of tall cells; (2) tall cell variant, >= 30% of tall cells; and (3) control cases selected from infiltrative classical PTCs without adverse cytologic features. Univariate, sensitivity, and multivariate analyses were performed with persistent/recurrent disease as the primary outcome. RESULTS: We identified 96 PTCs with focal tall cell change, 35 with the tall cell variant and 104 control cases. Factors associated with poor clinical prognosis were significantly greater in those with focal tall cell change and tall cell variants. Regarding primary outcome, hazard ratios were 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-5.7) for focal tall cell change, and 3.4 (95% CI 1.2-8.7) for tall cell variants compared with controls.

26430803,Modeling Linkage Disequilibrium Increases Accuracy of Polygenic Risk Scores.,"Polygenic risk scores have shown great promise in predicting complex disease risk and will become more accurate as training sample sizes increase. The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R(2) increased from 20.1% to 25.3% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8% to 12.0% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset.

25381388,The immunophenotype of mast cells and its utility in the diagnostic work-up of systemic mastocytosis.,"SM comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized by an abnormal accumulation of clonal MCs in 1 or more tissues, frequently involving the skin and BM. Despite the fact that most adult patients (>90%) carry the same genetic lesion (D816V KIT mutation), the disease presents with multiple variants with very distinct clinical and biologic features, a diverse prognosis, and different therapeutic requirements. Recent advances in the standardization of the study of BM MC by MFC allowed reproducible identification and characterization of normal/reactive MCs and their precursors, as well as the establishment of the normal MC maturational profiles. Analysis of large groups of patients versus normal/reactive samples has highlighted the existence of aberrant MC phenotypes in SM, which are essential for the diagnosis of the disease. In turn, 3 clearly distinct and altered maturation-associated immunophenotypic profiles have been reported recently in SM, which provide criteria for the distinction between ISM patients with MC-restricted and multilineage KIT mutation; thus, immunphenotyping also contributes to prognostic stratification of ISM, particularly when analysis of the KIT mutation on highly purified BM cells is not routinely available in the diagnostic work-up of the disease.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\25381388.txt,0,"SM comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized by an abnormal accumulation of clonal MCs in 1 or more tissues, frequently involving the skin and BM.

31427547,Androgen receptor expression in triple negative breast carcinoma and its association with the clinicopathological parameters.,"INTRODUCTION: Androgen receptor (AR) is the most frequently expressed biomarker in all subtypes of breast carcinoma. Triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) is breast carcinoma that lacks oestrogen and progesterone receptors immunoexpression as well as absence of HER2/neu gene amplification. This makes targeted therapy not feasible in this cancer and hence has poorer prognosis. Detecting AR expression could be another milestone in the management of TNBC, as AR is a prognostic, predictive marker and potential index for targeted treatment. This study aimed to assess expression of AR in TNBC by immunohistochemistry and its association with clinicopathological parameters. METHODS: We analysed the expression of AR in 97 TNBC cases from Penang General Hospital for a period of 3 years (2014 to 2017). Androgen receptor immunoreactivity was considered positive if >= 1% of tumour cells nuclei were stained irrespective of staining intensity. RESULTS: The prevalence of AR expression in TNBC was 31% (30/97), with the proportion of AR-positive tumour cells ranged from 1% to 90%. These include 23 invasive carcinomas, no special type (NST) and 7 other invasive carcinoma subtypes (papillary, lobular, clear cell and medullary carcinomas). Sixty-seven cases (69%) that showed AR immunonegativity were invasive carcinomas, NST (n=60), clear cell carcinoma (n=1) and metaplastic carcinoma (n=6). Androgen receptor immunoexpression was inversely correlated with tumour grade (p=0.016), but not the tumour stage, tumour size and nodal status. CONCLUSION: AR is expressed in about one-third of TNBC and loss of AR immunoexpression does not predict adverse clinical outcomes. Larger cohorts for better characterisation of the role of AR immunoexpression in TNBC are warranted.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31427547.txt,1,"INTRODUCTION: Androgen receptor (AR) is the most frequently expressed biomarker in all subtypes of breast carcinoma.

It is further responsible for leukemic clonal evolution. In this study, significant RAG1 increase is observed in the subsets of B-ALL patients, and high expression of RAG1 is observed to be correlated with high proliferation markers. IKZF1-encoded protein, IKAROS, directly binds to the RAG1 promoter and regulates RAG1 expression in leukemic cells. CK2 inhibitor by increasing IKAROS activity significantly suppresses RAG1 expression in ALL in an IKAROS-dependent manner. Patients with IKZF1 deletion have significantly higher expression of RAG1 compared to that without IKZF1 deletion. CK2 inhibitor treatment also results in an increase in IKZF1 binding to the RAG1 promoter and suppression of RAG1 expression in primary ALL cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RAG1 high expression is associated with high proliferation markers in B-ALL. Our data for the first time proved that RAG1 expression is directly suppressed by IKAROS.

Current guidelines state that molecular testing should be conducted at the time of initial diagnosis and tumor progression on targeted therapy. In real-world clinical practice in the United States (US), molecular testing is often not conducted or happens late in the diagnostic journey, resulting in delayed or inappropriate treatment. Herein, we review the rationale for molecular testing in advanced NSCLC, along with best-practice guidelines based on published recommendations and our own clinical experience, including a case study. We propose three strategies to optimize molecular testing in newly diagnosed patients with advanced NSCLC: (I) pulmonologists, interventional radiologists, or thoracic surgeons order molecular tests as soon as advanced NSCLC with an adenocarcinoma component is suspected; (II) liquid biopsies conducted early in the diagnostic pathway; and (III) pathologist-directed reflex testing, as conducted in other areas of oncology. To help facilitate these strategies, we outline our recommendations for optimal sample collection techniques and stewardship.

36930419,Copy number alteration is an independent prognostic biomarker in triple-negative breast cancer patients.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled comprehensive genomic profiling to identify gene alterations that play important roles in cancer biology. However, the clinical significance of these genomic alterations in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients has not yet been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of genomic profiling data, including copy number alterations (CNA) and tumor mutation burden (TMB), in TNBC patients.
A total of 47 patients with Stage I-III TNBC with genomic profiling of 435 known cancer genes by NGS were enrolled in this study. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated for their association to gene profiling data.
CNA-high patients showed significantly worse DFS and OS than CNA-low patients (p = 0.0009, p = 0.0041, respectively). TMB was not associated with DFS or OS in TNBC patients. Patients with TP53 alterations showed a tendency of worse DFS (p = 0.0953) and significantly worse OS (p = 0.0338) compared with patients without TP53 alterations.

31029168,Targeted capture-based NGS is superior to multiplex PCR-based NGS for hereditary BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene analysis in FFPE tumor samples.,"BACKGROUND: With the introduction of Olaparib treatment for BRCA-deficient recurrent ovarian cancer, testing for somatic and/or germline mutations in BRCA1/2 genes in tumor tissues became essential for treatment decisions. In most cases only formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, containing fragmented and chemically modified DNA of minor quality, are available. Thus, multiplex PCR-based sequencing is most commonly applied in routine molecular testing, which is predominantly focused on the identification of known hot spot mutations in oncogenes. METHODS: We compared the overall performance of an adjusted targeted capture-based enrichment protocol and a multiplex PCR-based approach for calling of pathogenic SNVs and InDels using DNA extracted from 13 FFPE tissue samples. We further applied both strategies to seven blood samples and five matched FFPE tumor tissues of patients with known germline exon-spanning deletions and gene-wide duplications in BRCA1/2 to evaluate CNV detection based solely on panel NGS data. Finally, we analyzed DNA from FFPE tissues of 11 index patients from families suspected of having hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, of whom no blood samples were available for testing, in order to identify underlying pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 mutations. RESULTS: The multiplex PCR-based protocol produced inhomogeneous coverage among targets of each sample and between samples as well as sporadic amplicon drop out, leading to insufficiently or non-covered nucleotides, which subsequently hindered variant detection. This protocol further led to detection of PCR-artifacts that could easily have been misinterpreted as pathogenic mutations. No such limitations were observed by application of an adjusted targeted capture-based protocol, which allowed for CNV calling with 86% sensitivity and 100% specificity. All pathogenic CNVs were confirmed in the five matched FFPE tumor samples from patients carrying known pathogenic germline mutations and we additionally identified somatic loss of the second allele in BRCA1/2. Furthermore we detected pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants in four the eleven FFPE samples from patients of whom no blood was available for analysis.

However, newborn screening (NBS) for this potentially fatal disease has not been established partly because reliable indices are not available. METHODS: We diagnosed CPT II deficiency in a 7-month-old boy presenting with hypoglycemic encephalopathy, which apparently had been missed in the NBS using C16 and C18:1 concentrations as indices. By referring to his acylcarnitine profile from the NBS, we adopted the (C16+C18:1)/C2 ratio (cutoff 0.62) and C16 concentration (cutoff 3.0nmol/mL) as alternative indices for CPT II deficiency such that an analysis of a dried blood specimen collected at postnatal day five retroactively yielded the correct diagnosis. Thereafter, positive cases were assessed by measuring (1) the fatty acid oxidation ability of intact lymphocytes and/or (2) CPT II activity in the lysates of lymphocytes. The diagnoses were then further confirmed by genetic analysis. RESULTS: The disease was diagnosed in seven of 21 newborns suspected of having CPT II deficiency based on NBS. We also analyzed the false-negative patient and five symptomatic patients for comparison. Values for the NBS indices of the false-negative, symptomatic patient were lower than those of the seven affected newborns. Although it was difficult to differentiate the false-negative patient from heterozygous carriers and false-positive subjects, the fatty acid oxidation ability of the lymphocytes and CPT II activity clearly confirmed the diagnosis. Among several other indices proposed previously, C14/C3 completely differentiated the seven NBS-positive patients and the false-negative patient from the heterozygous carriers and the false-positive subjects. Genetic analysis revealed 16 kinds of variant alleles. The most prevalent, detected in ten alleles in nine patients from eight families, was c.1148T>A (p.F383Y), a finding in line with those of several previous reports on Japanese patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that CPT II deficiency can be screened by using (C16+C18:1)/C2 and C16 as indices.

37394163,An improved recombinase polymerase amplification assay for the visual detection of Staphylococcus epidermidis with lateral flow strips.,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogenic microorganism that is an important cause of cross-infection in hospitals. The development of rapid and effective detection techniques is important for its control. The application of traditional identification and PCR-based methods is limited by their requirements for both laboratory instrumentation and trained personnel. To overcome this issue, we developed a fast detection approach for S. epidermidis that was based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and lateral flow strips (LFS). First, five pairs of primers were designed for molecular diagnosis using the sesB gene as the target, and were screened for their amplification performance and the formation of primer dimers. Specific probes were then designed based on the best primer pairs screened, which were susceptible to primer-dependent artifacts and generated false-positive signals when used for LFS detection. This weakness of the LFS assay was overcome by modifying the sequences of the primers and probes. The efficacy of these measures was rigorously tested, and improved the RPA-LFS system. Standardized systems completed the amplification process within 25 min at a constant temperature of 37°C, followed by visualization of the LFS within 3 min. The approach was very sensitive (with a detection limit of 8.91 CFU/μL), with very good interspecies specificity. In the analysis of clinical samples, the approach produced results consistent with PCR and 97.78% consistent with the culture-biochemical method, with a kappa index of 0.938. Our method was rapid, accurate, and less dependent on equipment and trained personnel than traditional methods, and provided information for the timely development of rational antimicrobial treatment plans. It has high potential utility in clinical settings, particularly in resource-constrained locations.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\37394163.txt,0,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogenic microorganism that is an important cause of cross-infection in hospitals.

24475179,Plakophilin-3 catenin associates with the ETV1/ER81 transcription factor to positively modulate gene activity.,"Members of the plakophilin-catenin sub-family (Pkp-1, -2, and -3) facilitate the linkage of desmosome junctional components to each other (e.g. desmosomal cadherins to desmoplakin) and the intermediate-filament cytoskeleton. Pkps also contribute to desmosomal stabilization and the trafficking of its components. The functions of Pkps outside of the desmosome are less well studied, despite evidence suggesting their roles in mRNA regulation, small-GTPase modulation (e.g. mid-body scission) during cell division, and cell survival following DNA damage. Pkp-catenins are further believed to have roles in the nucleus given their nuclear localization in some contexts and the known nuclear roles of structurally related catenins, such as beta-catenin and p120-catenin. Further, Pkp-catenin activities in the nuclear compartment have become of increased interest with the identification of interactions between Pkp2-catenin and RNA Pol III and Pkp1 with single-stranded DNA. Consistent with earlier reports suggesting possible nuclear roles in development, we previously demonstrated prominent nuclear localization of Pkp3 in Xenopus naive ectoderm (""animal cap"") cells and recently resolved a similar localization in mouse embryonic stem cells. Here, we report the association and positive functional interaction of Pkp3 with a transcription factor, Ets variant gene 1 (ETV1), which has critical roles in neural development and prominent roles in human genetic disease.

To reach this goal, we investigated the prevalence of genetic variants in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis genes in a cohort of euploid fetuses with CH that almost resolved before delivery. A short review of cases from literature is also reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five fetuses were screened using a next-generation sequencing approach by targeting 33 genes known to be associated with vascular and lymphatic malformations. The genetic evaluation revealed two novel variants in KDR and KRIT1 genes. CONCLUSION: A review of the literature to date revealed that an association exists between CH and hereditary lymphedema and, similar to lymphedema, CH can be inherited in autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant manner, with the latter most likely associated with a better prognosis. About KDR and KRIT1 genes, no other similar associations are reported in the literature and caution is needed in their interpretation.

However, the conventional virus-based reprogramming approach is associated with a high risk of genetic mutation and limits their therapeutic utility. Here, we successfully generated iPSCs from readily accessible human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) through an integration-free and feeder-free approach via delivery of reprogramming factors of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, L-myc, Lin28 and TP53 shRNA with episomal plasmid vectors. The iPSCs presented similar morphology and proliferation characteristics as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and expressed pluripotent markers including Oct4, Tra181, Nanog and SSEA-4. Additionally, these cells maintained a normal karyotype and showed decreased CpG methylation ratio in the promoter regions of Oct4 and Nanog. In vivo teratoma formation assay revealed the development of tissues representative of three germ layers, confirming the acquisition of pluripotency. Furthermore, treatment of the iPSCs in vitro with enamel matrix derivative (EMD) or growth/differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) significantly up-regulated the expression of periodontal tissue markers associated with bone, periodontal ligament and cementum respectively.

30927944,Radiogenomics of rectal adenocarcinoma in the era of precision medicine: A pilot study of associations between qualitative and quantitative MRI imaging features and genetic mutations.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between genetic mutations and qualitative as well as quantitative features on MRI in rectal adenocarcinoma at primary staging. METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, genome sequencing, and pretreatment rectal MRI were included. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate associations between qualitative features obtained from subjective evaluation of rectal MRI and gene mutations as well as between quantitative textural features and gene mutations. For the qualitative evaluation, Fisher's Exact test was used to analyze categorical associations and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used for continuous clinical variables. For the quantitative evaluation, we performed manual segmentation of T2-weighted images for radiomics-based quantitative image analysis. Thirty-four texture features consisting of first order intensity histogram-based features (n = 4), second order Haralick textures (n = 5), and Gabor-edge based Haralick textures were computed at two different orientations. Consensus clustering was performed with 34 computed texture features using the K-means algorithm with Euclidean distance between the texture features. The clusters resulting from the algorithm were then used to enumerate the prevalence of gene mutations in those clusters. RESULTS: In 65 patients, 45 genes were mutated in more than 3/65 patients (5%) and were included in the statistical analysis. Regarding qualitative imaging features, on univariate analysis, tumor location was significantly associated with APC (p = 0.032) and RASA1 mutation (p = 0.032); CRM status was significantly associated with ATM mutation (p = 0.021); and lymph node metastasis was significantly associated with BRCA2 (p = 0.046) mutation. However, these associations were not significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding quantitative imaging features, Cluster C1 had tumors with higher mean Gabor edge intensity compared with cluster C2 (theta = 0 , p = 0.018; theta = 45 , p = 0.047; theta = 90 , p = 0.037; cluster C3 (theta = 0 , p = 0.18; theta = 45 , p = 0.1; theta = 90 , p = 0.052), and cluster C4 (theta = 0 , p = 0.016; theta = 45 , p = 0.033; theta = 90 , p = 0.014) suggesting that the cluster C1 had tumors with more distinct edges or heterogeneous appearance compared with other clusters.

A previous study has shown that the G2 and S phase-expressed-1 (GTSE1) can act as an oncogene in several human cancers. However, its functional roles in breast cancer remain elusive. METHOD: In this study, we analyzed breast cancer data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases and other online database including the Oncomine, bc-GenExMiner and PROGgeneV2 database to identify the molecules contributing to the progression of breast cancer. The GTSE1 expression levels were investigated using qRT-PCR, immunoblotting and IHC. The biological function of GTSE1 in the growth, migration and invasion of breast cancer was examined in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 cell lines. The in vitro cell proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities were evaluated by MTS, colony formation and transwell assay, respectively. The role of GTSE1 in the growth and metastasis of breast cancer were revealed by in vivo investigation using BALB/c nude mice. RESULTS: We showed that the expression level of GTSE1 was upregulated in breast cancer specimens and cell lines, especially in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and p53 mutated breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, high GTSE1 expression was positively correlated with histological grade and poor survival. We demonstrated that GTSE1 could promote breast cancer cell growth by activating the AKT pathway and enhance metastasis by regulating the Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Furthermore, it could cause multidrug resistance in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that GTSE1 could regulate the p53 function to alter the cell cycle distribution dependent on the mutation state of p53.

Participants were of European ancestry from the UK Biobank without prevalent CAD. An externally trained genome-wide CAD PRS was generated and then applied. Clinical risk factors were ascertained at baseline. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to examine the incident CAD effects of CAD PRS, risk factors, and their interactions. Next, the PRS and risk factors were stratified to investigate the attributable risk of clinical risk factors.

The skin is the organ most frequently involved, but all organs may be affected. The clinical signs and symptoms are produced by the functional effects of mast cell-derived mediators and the anatomical distribution of the mast cells. The 2008 WHO-classification defines 7 categories of mastocytosis. Skin disease, with or without systemic involvement, is by far the most common form of childhood mastocytosis. Measurement of serum tryptase is important in the diagnostic algorithm of pediatric mastocytosis. In children with tryptase <20 ng/mL, the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) may be decided upon without bone marrow examination (BME), unless other signs of SM are present. If the baseline tryptase level exceeds 100 ng/mL, a BME should be considered regardless of age. If the serum tryptase is 20-100 ng/mL in children without other signs of SM, the provisional diagnosis ""mastocytosis in the skin"" (MIS) can be established and monitored until puberty. If MIS remains present after puberty, a BME should be performed. In adult-onset mastocytosis a complete staging and application of the systemic mastocytosis criteria should always be performed.

26967226,Metformin Facilitates Amyloid-beta Generation by beta- and gamma-Secretases via Autophagy Activation.,"The evidence of strong pathological associations between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has increased in recent years. Contrary to suggestions that anti-diabetes drugs may have potential for treating AD, we demonstrate here that the insulin sensitizing anti-diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage ) increased the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), one of the major pathological hallmarks of AD, by promoting beta- and gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, we show that metformin caused autophagosome accumulation in Tg6799 AD model mice. Extremely high gamma-secretase activity was also detected in autophagic vacuoles, apparently a novel site of Abeta peptide generation. Together, these data suggest that metformin-induced accumulation of autophagosomes resulted in increased gamma-secretase activity and Abeta generation. Additional experiments indicated that metformin increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which activates autophagy by suppressing mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The suppression of mTOR then induces the abnormal accumulation of autophagosomes.

36929074,Statistical Methods for Integrative Clustering of Multi-omics Data.,"Cancers are heterogeneous diseases caused by accumulated mutations or abnormal alterations at multi-levels of biological processes including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. There is a great clinical interest in identifying cancer molecular subtypes for disease prognosis and personalized medicine. Integrative clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning method that has been increasingly used to identify cancer molecular subtypes using multi-omics data including somatic mutations, DNA copy numbers, DNA methylation, and gene expression. Integrative clustering methods are generally classified into model-based or nonparametric approaches. In this chapter, we will give an overview of the frequently used model-based methods, including iCluster, iClusterPlus, and iClusterBayes, and the nonparametric method, integrative nonnegative matrix factorization (intNMF). We will use the integrative analyses of uveal melanoma and lower-grade glioma to illustrate these representative methods.

36621979,Loss of CBX2 causes genomic instability and Wnt activation in high grade serous ovarian carcinoma cells.,"High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is lethal with insidious onset, rapid progression, poor prognosis, and limited treatment options. Polycomb repressor complexes (PRC) 1 and 2 are intimately involved in progression of many types of cancer including HGSOC. Unlike the consistent constitution of PRC2, PRC1 consists of diverse components whose clinical significance in HGSOC are not entirely clear. Here, prognosis-associated PRC1 components were identified through data-mining. CBX2 promoted proliferation and reduced apoptosis of HGSOC cell lines OVCAR4, OVCAR3, and CAOV3. Complete loss of CBX2 by CRISPR-cas9 editing (CBX2<sup>KO</sup> ) destabilized genome stability with increased spontaneous chromosomal breaks and tendency to polyploidy accompanied by disrupted cell cycle especially stalled G2/M transition and caused severe cell death. Wnt/β-catenin/LEF1/TCF7L1 was activated in surviving OVCAR4-CBX2<sup>KO</sup> clones to bypass the crisis caused by loss of CBX2. The relieve of TCF7L1 core-promoter region occupied by CBX2 might be one of the possible explanations to TCF7L1 increase in OVCAR4-CBX2<sup>KO</sup> clones.

24780089,New molecular diagnostic kit to assess Y-chromosome deletions in the Japanese population.,"OBJECTIVES: Deletions in the azoospermia factor regions are the most common known molecular genetic cause of human male infertility involving spermatogenetic failure. Testing for these deletions in Japanese DNA samples using conventional sequence-tagged site probes occasionally lead to considerable non-specific or faint products in the Japanese population. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a newly developed kit for the detection of azoospermia factor microdeletions in the Japanese population. METHODS: Sequence-tagged site probes were reselected and the Luminex suspension array assay was carried out. Validation was retrospectively carried out with 2014 DNA sequences with known microdeletions, which were divided into four categories. RESULTS: Category 1 deletions that corresponded to the conventional classification of azoospermia factor deletion were present in 83 men (4.2%), which can result in intrachromosomal homologous recombination. Kit data confirmed the presence of deletions of this type in DNA sequences known to harbor the azoospermia factor deletions. Category 2 deletions involved cytogenetic abnormalities in 28 men (1.4%), whereas category 3 deletions in 759 men (37.7%) were atypical classifications including the gr/gr deletion. As these deletions are thought to be a result of palindromic units and non-homologous recombination, these microdeletions might impact in the interpretation of some clinical findings. The rest of the 1145 cases (56.8%) were assigned to category 4 as normal variants (polymorphism/no deletion). CONCLUSIONS: The present findings show that this new kit offers good sensitivity and specificity with the advantage of saving in terms of cost and time.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\24780089.txt,0,"OBJECTIVES: Deletions in the azoospermia factor regions are the most common known molecular genetic cause of human male infertility involving spermatogenetic failure.

We aimed to characterize HB related to APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) germline mutation (APC-HB). This French multicentric retrospective study included 12 APC-HB patients under 5 at diagnosis. Clinical features of APC-HB were compared to the French SIOPEL2-3 cohort of HB patients. Molecular and histopathological analyses of APC-HB were compared to 15 consecutive sporadic HB treated at Bicetre hospital from 2013 to 2015 (non-APC-HB). APC-HB patients have a peculiar spectrum of germline APC mutations, with no events in the main hotspot of classical APC mutations at codon 1309 (P < .05). Compared to sporadic HB, they have similar clinical features including good prognosis since all patients are alive in complete remission at last follow-up. APC-HB are mostly well-limited tumors with fetal predominance and few mesenchymal components. All APC-HB have an activated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway without CTNNB1 mutation, confirming that germline APC and somatic CTNNB1 mutations are mutually exclusive (P < .001). Pathological reviewing identified massive intratumor tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) containing both lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells in all 11 APC-HB cases who received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy but not in five pre-chemotherapy samples (four paired biopsies and one patient resected without chemotherapy), indicating that these TLS are induced by chemotherapy (P < .001).

31319986,Novel multiplex droplet digital PCR assay for scoring PD-L1 in non-small cell lung cancer biopsy specimens.,"OBJECTIVES: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become integrated into the clinical management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using RTqPCR, we have previously identified a gene expression panel that detected presence of malignant cells (MMP9:TIMP3 ratio) and quantified PD-L1 transcript levels in small biopsy specimens. However, RTqPCR has diagnostic limitations as it does not generate absolute copy number and is not readily multiplexed. To address this, we have developed a multiplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsies obtained from NSCLC patients (n = 48 adenocarcinoma and n = 40 squamous cell carcinoma) and control lung biopsy specimens (n = 20) were analysed. Absolute MMP9, TIMP3 and PD-L1 transcript copy numbers were determined within a single assay by multiplex ddPCR using Taqman primers and the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Using our optimised triplex ddPCR assay, the MMP9:TIMP3 ratio was significantly elevated in NSCLC biopsies and using a cut-off of >0.028, was 99% (95% CI; 80.5-94.5) sensitive and 80% specific for identifying malignant biopsies.

In summary, a major advantage of our workflow is that it can accurately quantify PD-L1 tumour levels and provide sufficient nucleic acid for screening additional targetable mutations such as EGFR, ALK and ROS1 from a single small biopsy, thereby potentially avoiding the need for re-biopsy.

24962530,Evaluation and optimisation of indel detection workflows for ion torrent sequencing of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.,"BACKGROUND: The Ion Torrent PGM is a popular benchtop sequencer that shows promise in replacing conventional Sanger sequencing as the gold standard for mutation detection. Despite the PGM's reported high accuracy in calling single nucleotide variations, it tends to generate many false positive calls in detecting insertions and deletions (indels), which may hinder its utility for clinical genetic testing. RESULTS: Recently, the proprietary analytical workflow for the Ion Torrent sequencer, Torrent Suite (TS), underwent a series of upgrades. We evaluated three major upgrades of TS by calling indels in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Our analysis revealed that false negative indels could be generated by TS under both default calling parameters and parameters adjusted for maximum sensitivity. However, indel calling with the same data using the open source variant callers, GATK and SAMtools showed that false negatives could be minimised with the use of appropriate bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, we identified two variant calling measures, Quality-by-Depth (QD) and VARiation of the Width of gaps and inserts (VARW), which substantially reduced false positive indels, including non-homopolymer associated errors without compromising sensitivity. In our best case scenario that involved the TMAP aligner and SAMtools, we achieved 100% sensitivity, 99.99% specificity and 29% False Discovery Rate (FDR) in indel calling from all 23 samples, which is a good performance for mutation screening using PGM. CONCLUSIONS: New versions of TS, BWA and GATK have shown improvements in indel calling sensitivity and specificity over their older counterpart. However, the variant caller of TS exhibits a lower sensitivity than GATK and SAMtools. Our findings demonstrate that although indel calling from PGM sequences may appear to be noisy at first glance, proper computational indel calling analysis is able to maximize both the sensitivity and specificity at the single base level, paving the way for the usage of this technology for future clinical genetic testing.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Non-Cancer\24962530.txt,0,"BACKGROUND: The Ion Torrent PGM is a popular benchtop sequencer that shows promise in replacing conventional Sanger sequencing as the gold standard for mutation detection. Despite the PGMs reported high accuracy in calling single nucleotide variations, it tends to generate many false positive calls in detecting insertions and deletions (indels), which may hinder its utility for clinical genetic testing. RESULTS: Recently, the proprietary analytical workflow for the Ion Torrent sequencer, Torrent Suite (TS), underwent a series of upgrades. We evaluated three major upgrades of TS by calling indels in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.

31304427,Pathology of pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy and estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030. Although overall 5-year survival rates have constantly remained below 10% for the last decades, several key points important for accurate patient stratification have emerged during recent years. These key points include a highly standardized gross examination of PDAC resection specimens, using an axial slicing technique and inking of the circumferential resection margin (CRM), as well as a meticulous microscopic examination, taking into account the prognostic relevance of factors such as the exact resection status (R0 vs. R1 1-mm vs. R1 resection), histopathological tumor grading and the so-called lymph node ratio (LNR). With increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy in PDAC, tumor regression grading (TRG) for PDAC is currently rising in relevance in order to stratify and manage pre-operatively treated PDAC patients. As all current TRG systems for PDAC are unsatisfactory, new standardized international protocols are urgently needed. Several morphological subtypes of PDAC exist, some of which share the same molecular background with classical PDAC, while others are characterized by a distinct molecular pathogenesis. While some show a prognosis similar to classical PDAC, other subtypes stand out due to a better or even worse prognosis than classical PDAC. Prognostic relevant molecular subtypes of PDAC have been proposed as well, however, limitations of used cohorts and the lacking correlation of molecular subtypes with histomorphological subtypes limit the translation of these findings into valuable clinical applications. Lastly, several macroscopic and microscopic precursor lesions of PDAC have been described in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and humans in recent times, providing further insight into PDAC carcinogenesis. In addition, improved diagnosis of PDAC precursors represents a chance to select patients for resection before invasive PDAC is present.",Dataset__1_\Dataset\Cancer\31304427.txt,1,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy and estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030.

We conducted a retrospective, exploratory biomarker analysis of patients from DECISION. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Candidate biomarkers [15 baseline plasma proteins, baseline and during-treatment serum thyroglobulin, and relevant tumor mutations (BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS)] were analyzed for correlation with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Plasma biomarker and thyroglobulin data were available for 395 of 417 (94.7%) and 403 of 417 (96.6%) patients, respectively. Elevated baseline VEGFA was independently associated with poor prognosis for progression-free survival [PFS; HR = 1.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.38-2.44; P = 0.0007], overall survival (HR = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.37-3.36; P = 0.013), and disease-control rate (DCR; OR = 0.30; P = 0.009).

Combined VEGFA/thyroglobulin signatures correlated with poor PFS (HR = 2.12; 95% CI, 1.57-2.87; P < 0.00001). Thyroglobulin decrease >=30% from baseline was achieved by 76% and 14% of patients receiving sorafenib and placebo, respectively (P < 0.001).

BRAF and TERT mutations have been extensively related to prognosis in thyroid cancer. In this study, the methylation levels of selected CpGs (5-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3) comprising a classifier, previously reported by our group, were assessed in combination with BRAF and TERT mutations. We evaluated 121 WDTC, three poorly-differentiated/anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (PDTC/ATC), 22 benign thyroid lesions (BTL), and 13 non-neoplastic thyroid (NT) tissues. BRAF (V600E) and TERT promoter (C228T and C250T) mutations were tested by pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing, respectively. Three CpGs mapped in PFKFB2, ATP6V0C, and CXXC5 were evaluated by bisulfite pyrosequencing. ATP6V0C hypermethylation and PFKFB2 hypomethylation were detected in poor-prognosis (PDTC/ATC and relapsed WDTC) compared with good-prognosis (no relapsed WDTC) and non-malignant cases (NT/BTL). CXXC5 was hypomethylated in both poor and good-prognosis cases. Shorter disease-free survival was observed in WDTC patients presenting lower PFKFB2 methylation levels (p = 0.004). No association was observed on comparing BRAF (60.7%) and TERT (3.4%) mutations and prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Cowden syndrome is characterized by inactivating germline PTEN mutations, which can lead to activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. METHODS: Adult subjects with germline PTEN mutation who met international diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome and who had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 and adequate organ function were enrolled. Subjects were treated with a 56-day course of daily oral sirolimus. In addition to symptom assessment and physical examination, dermatologic, endoscopic, neurologic (cerebellar), and radiographic assessments were conducted.

This study explored the role of NSE in macrophage polarization associated with the immune microenvironment of DLBCL. Results: Our results showed that NSE protein expression was higher in lymphoma cell lines than in the B lymphocytes. Functional studies demonstrated that upregulation of NSE in lymphoma cells could promote M2 polarization and migration ability of macrophage, thereby consequently promoting the progression of lymphoma in vitro and in vivo.
